# Character Progression
Alongside their character sheet, each player is given a second page to describe the person being played and note down their escapades.<br>
After a challenge has been overcome, jot it down as a named Feat and assign it a value of 1 to 5 Experience Points, or EXP. After a Feat has been named, it cannot be named again.<br>
Commonly, defeating a new kind of monster is a Feat worth EXP equal to its Level, and finishing a multi-step quest is a Feat worth EXP equal to the highest EXP value among the challenges that were overcome as part of the process, including anything that has already been named a Feat.
<br><br>

With every 5 EXP gained, you may pick one new Talent and either assign a d4 to a Skill with no die assigned to it or increase the size of a die assigned to a Skill by 2, up to 12.<br>
Every 20 EXP gained, your level is increased by 1, up to 5.

# Grading Adventures: Levels
Your experience as an adventurer is represented by your Level; A rough scale meant to show how dangerous of an adventure you could handle and how great the stakes could be if you fail.<br><br>

Unleveled | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 | Beyond Levels
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 EXP | 1 EXP | 2 EXP | 3 EXP | 4 EXP | 5 EXP | 5 EXP
Personal Stakes | Local Stakes | Building Stakes | Town Stakes | Regional Stakes | National Stakes | Global Stakes
Bandits or Wolves | Trained Soldiers or Bears | Elite Mercenaries or Elephants | Death Knights or Dinosaurs | Runesark Giants or Greater Demons | Archangels or Anchient Dragons | Literal Gods or Primordial Titans
Could pair up to take down an adventurer | Could defeat two guards at once | Could fight back a room full of people | Could take down a squad of mercenaries at once | Could defeat a military fort by itself | Could fight back an entire army | Could take over or destroy the world
####

As a general rule, A level X monster will put up a fair fight against a single level X adventurer.<br>
Together, two level X adventurers can take down a single level X+1 monster.<br>
If you want a greater challenge for your party, and/or have a larger party that needs greater threats to be challenged, consider having multiple sets of enemies (1 level 2X = 3 level X = 6 level X/2 = X level 1) and force the players to spread out their efforts? (THIS SCALE WILL DETERMINE THE ENTIRE GAME FEEL)

### Approximate Level-Grading???
If a creature's Level is X, that implies the following about its power:
+ Maximum HP = Att/2 * HP Bonus + X
+ Maximum MP = Att/2 * MP Bonus + X
+ Defence = Att + ~2X
+ Actions = d8/"Proficiency Die"/"Between d8 and Prof. Die"
####

### Improvised Damage??? (WRONG SCALING!)
We can use Level Dice to determine the power of situational damage dealt by the environment.<br>
1 for Mundane/Unlevelled -> d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 - d12 -> d20 for Cataclysmic/Beyond Levels.
<br><br>

One die is minor. Use for repeated stuff, like "breathing the posing" or "standing in the fire". Such effects could be of a lower Level than the party.

Two dice is a big setback. Use for one-time events, like "exploding the barrel" or ???. Such effects should be of the same Level as the party.

Three dice is a potentially lethal ordeal. Use it for catastrophic one-time events to avoid, like "bringing down the building" or "falling into the acid". Such effects could be of a higher Level than the party and saved as "the consequence of failure".<br><br>

Regardless of the scale or severity, allow each target to make an appropriate Save to take half as much damage on a success. The Difficulty of such a Save should be equal to 10 + 2 * X.
