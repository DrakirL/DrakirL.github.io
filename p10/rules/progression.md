# Character Progression
Alongside their character sheet, each player is given a second page to describe the person being played and note down their escapades.<br>
After a challenge has been overcome, jot it down as a named Feat and assign it a value of 1 to 5 Experience Points, or EXP. After a Feat has been named, it cannot be named again.<br>
Commonly, defeating a new kind of monster is a Feat worth EXP equal to its Level, and finishing a multi-step quest is a Feat worth EXP equal to the highest EXP value among the challenges that were overcome as part of the process, including anything that has already been named a Feat.
<br><br>

With every 5 EXP gained, you may pick one new Talent and increase their Grade for one Skill by 1.<br>
Every 20 EXP gained, your level is increased by 1, up to 5.

# Grading Adventures: Levels
Your experience as an adventurer is represented by your Level; A rough scale meant to show how dangerous of an adventure you could handle and how great the stakes could be if you fail.<br><br>

Unleveled | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 | Beyond Levels
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 EXP | 1 EXP | 2 EXP | 3 EXP | 4 EXP | 5 EXP | 5 EXP
Personal Stakes | Local Stakes | Building Stakes | Town Stakes | Regional Stakes | National Stakes | Global Stakes
Bandits or Wolves | Trained Soldiers or Bears | Elite Mercenaries or Elephants | Death Knights or Dinosaurs | Runesark Giants or Greater Demons | Archangels or Anchient Dragons | Literal Gods or Primordial Titans
Could pair up to take down an adventurer | Could defeat two guards at once | Could fight back a room full of people | Could take down a squad of mercenaries at once | Could defeat a military fort by itself | Could fight back an entire army | Could take over or destroy the world
####

As a general rule, A level X monster will put up a fair fight against a single level X adventurer.<br>
Together, two level X adventurers can take down a single level X+1 monster.<br>
If you want a greater challenge for your party, and/or have a larger party that needs greater threats to be challenged, consider having multiple sets of enemies (1 level 2X = 3 level X = 6 level X/2 = X level 1) and force the players to spread out their efforts? (THIS SCALE WILL DETERMINE THE ENTIRE GAME FEEL)

If all actions are used to successfully deal damage, such a fight could easily be over in two rounds.<br>
If you want a greater challenge for your adventuring party, and/or have a larger party that needs greater threats to be challenged, consider having multiple sets of enemies and force the players to spread out their efforts over multiple fights and/or as separate targets in a single fight.

### Approximate Level-Grading
If a creature's Level is X, that implies the following about its power:
+ Maximum HP = Size + Att. + HP Bonus * X
+ Maximum MP = Size + Att. + MP Bonus * X
+ Attack Bonus = ~4 + X
+ Defence = ~12 + X
+ Baseline DPR = ~3 + 3 * X
####

The HP Bonus is determined by the manner in which creature fights.<br>
If it relies entirely on its instincts to fight, like most beasts do, the bonus is equal to the value of its Size.<br>
If it has *learned* how to fight, the bonus is determined by how used they are to feeling pain. Examples: 1 for a child, 2 for a commoner, 3 for a trained guard, 4 for a wild savage, 5 for someone who can't feel pain at all.
<br><br>

The MP Bonus is determined by the how in tune the creature is the magic around and within them.<br>
Examples: 1 for a beast, 2 for a commoner, 3 for a trained caster, 4 for a scholar of magic, 5 for a someone who is intrisicly linked with the weave.

### "Bosses": Worthy Foes? (APPROPRIATE? BALANCED? NEEDED?)
Sometimes you have a named opponent with enough narrative importance that you don't want them to go down too fast, even going against a balanced party by itself.<br>
When you want a single creature alone to be a good challenge for a regular 2-4 player party, you can give it the Aura of a Worthy Foe.
<br><br>

The Aura of a Worthy Foe grants it the following benefits:
+ It gains 10 Temporary HP for each player it is opposing when it enters an Action Scene.
+ While it has no allies in the current Action Scene, it takes two turns each round instead of one.

### Improvised Damage
We can use Level Dice to determine the power of situational damage dealt by the environment.<br>
1 for Mundane/Unlevelled -> d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 - d12 -> d20 for Cataclysmic/Beyond Levels.
<br><br>

One die is a painful but ultimately managable hit. Use it for effects that linger and trigger every turn, like breathing poison gas or standing on hot coals. Such effects could resonably be of a lower Level than the party and still provide an obsticle.
<br><br>

Two dice is some serious damage when not expected. Use it for effects that are only used once each, like a triggered bear trap or an exploding barrel of gunpowder. Such effects should be of the same Level as the party if the impact to *REALLY* be felt.
<br><br>

Three dice is a potentially lethal ordeal. Use it for catastrophic one-time events to avoid, like "the building collapsing" or "plunging into the acid". Such effects could be of a higher Level than the party and saved as "the consequence of failure".
<br><br>

Regardless of the scale or severity, allow each target to make an appropriate Save to take half as much damage on a success. The Difficulty of such a Save should be equal to 10 + 2 * X.
