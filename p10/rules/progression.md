# Character Progression
After you finish an Adventure, your character should be rewarded with significantly refreshing downtime and have gained significant experience, depending of the "level" of the adventure. <br>
At the very least, everyone should get a "long rest" where they regain all or their lost HP and expended resources, including things like Spell Slots that can be used X times per Adventure. <br>
Then, the GM decides whether your characters should progress to a greater Level, or if there are more stories to tell on the current scale. <br>
Either way, each participant may jot down the finished adventure as an Experience/Saga/Tale/Memory/Feat?

## Party Sheet
Some stories need not to be drawn out. In such cases it is enough to have the players fill out their character sheets at the given level. <br>
Other times, the story needs to show real growth of ability and experience gained. In those cases, the party are also given a Party Sheet. <br>
On the Party Sheet, the party write down the tenets of a chosen Oath (suggestions are at the buttom of this page). After each session, take the time to review and see if the party has fulfilled the tenets of their Oath. For each tenet filled, the party gains 1 XP *(up to 5)*. The XP-track on the sheet can hold up to 10 without the party levelling up.

## Tales
On your sheet, you have space enough to write down what adventures your character has completed in the form of Tales. A newly made character starts with one; their backstory. <br>
If you make a Check and fail, you may explain to the GM how the moment relates to one of your noted Tales and why you MUST succeed. With the GM's permission, you may cross out the Tale to succeed on that Check instead. <br>
*How should used tales be regained? Per Adventure? Even less often? Special conditions?*

# Grading Adventures: Levels
Your experience as an adventurer is represented by your Level; A rough scale meant to show how dangerous of an adventure you could handle and how great the stakes could be if you fail. <br>
You can expect your party to have to fight at least 1 creature with a CR equal to your level by the time an adventure is finished. <br>

<br><br>
1 - 2 | 3 - 4 | 5 - 6 | 7 - 8 | 9 - 10 
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Personal | Local | National | Global | Universal 
Your family! | Your village! | Your country! | Your world! | Everything!
The whole building! | The whole city! | The whole Kingdom! | Civilization as you know it! | Existence as you know it!

## Challenge Rating? "Monster Attributes"?
Challenge Rating (CR) is a scale used to determine how threatening a monster is to an adventuring party. <br>
If a creature's Level = X >= 1, that means the following:
+ HP = [2 - 7] + X * Size[1 - 5]
+ Defence = X + [5 - 10]
+ Hit = X + [0 - 5]
+ Burst = ~5 + 2 * X
+ DPR? = ~5 + X?
#### <br>

As a general rule, A level X monster will put up a fair fight against a single level X adventurer.<br>
The greatest single threat that a trio of level X adventurers could expect to take on, is a level X+5 monster. <br>
If you want a greater challenge for your party, and/or have a larger party that needs greater threats to be challenged, consider having multiple sets of enemies (3 CR X = 6 CR X/2 = X CR 1) and force the players to spread out their efforts.

### Special CR values
**0:** Basic cannon fodder, like a commoner or a goblin. Its maximum output in a round is on par with 1 Action from an adventurer, and it could die from a single hit. <br>
+ HP = 2 + Size[1 - 5]
+ Defence = [5 - 10]?
+ Hit = 0
+ Burst = ~5
+ DPA = 1
#### <br>
**1/2:** The commoners greatest threat, such as a wolf or a LotR orc. As powerful as a Level 0 adventurer. <br>
+ HP = [2 - 7] + Size[1 - 5]
+ Defence = ~10
+ Hit = [0 - 5]
+ Burst = ~7?
+ DPA = ~2
#### <br>

# OATHS
Everyone around the table should be on board with the chosen Oath, beacuse its purpose is to set the tone for a campaign. <br>
