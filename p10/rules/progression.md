# Character Progression
Alongside their individual character sheets, the party is given a "party sheet" to represent them as a collective.<br>
After the party overcomes a challenge, jot it down on the party sheet as a named Feat and assign it a value of 1 to 5 Experience Points, or EXP. After a Feat has been named, it cannot be named again.<br>
Commonly, defeating a new kind of monster is a Feat worth EXP equal to its Level, and finishing a multi-step quest is a Feat worth EXP equal to the highest EXP value among the challenges that were overcome as part of the process, including anything that has already been named a Feat.
<br<br>

When a Feat is named this way, add its EXP value to the party's total EXP.<br>
Every 5 EXP the party gains, its members may pick one new Talent each.<be>
Every 10 EXP the party gains, its members' Levels increase by 1 each, up to 5.

## Individual Improvement: Talents
While your character is resting, you may give it some new talents.<br>
Each talent may have one or more restrictions your character must meet in order for that talent to be an available option. The most common restrictions are "Minimum Level", "Class", and "Subclass".

## Scaling Stakes: Levels
Your experience as an adventurer is represented by your Level; A rough scale meant to show how dangerous of an adventure you could handle and how great the stakes could be if you fail.<br>
Rules of thumb: A single Level X adventurer can take on a single Level X monster in a fair fight. A pair of Level X adventurers can take on a single Level X+1 monster if they work together.
<br><br>

Unleveled | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 | Beyond Levels
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 EXP | 1 EXP | 2 EXP | 3 EXP | 4 EXP | 5 EXP | 5 EXP
Personal Stakes | Local Stakes | Building Stakes | Town Stakes | Regional Stakes | National Stakes | Global Stakes
Bandits or Wolves | Trained Soldiers or Bears | Elite Mercenaries or Elephants | Death Knights or Dinosaurs | Runesark Giants or Greater Demons | Archangels or Anchient Dragons | Literal Gods or Primordial Titans
Could form a pair to take down an adventurer | Could defeat two guards at once | Could fight back a room full of people | Could take down a squad of mercenaries at once | Could defeat a military fort by itself | Could fight back an entire army | Could take over or destroy the world
####

If all actions are used to successfully deal damage, such a fight could easily be over in two rounds.<br>
If you want a greater challenge for your adventuring party, and/or have a larger party that needs greater threats to be challenged, consider having multiple sets of enemies and force the players to spread out their efforts over multiple fights and/or as separate targets in a single fight.

### Approximate Level-Grading
If a creature's Level is X, that implies the following about its power:
+ Maximum HP = Size + Att. + HP Bonus * X
+ Maximum MP = Size + Att. + MP Bonus * X
+ Attack = ~4 + X
+ Defence = ~8 + X
+ Baseline DPR = ~3 + 3 * X
####

The HP Bonus is determined by the manner in which creature fights.<br>
If it relies entirely on its instincts to fight, like most beasts do, the bonus is equal to the value of its Size.<br>
If it has *learned* how to fight, the bonus is determined by how used they are to feeling pain. Examples: 1 for a child, 2 for a commoner, 3 for a trained guard, 4 for a wild savage, 5 for someone who can't feel pain at all.
<br><br>

The MP Bonus is determined by the how in tune the creature is the magic around and within them.<br>
Examples: 1 for a beast, 2 for a commoner, 3 for a trained caster, 4 for a scholar of magic, 5 for a someone who is intrisicly linked with the weave.

### "Bosses": Worthy Foes
Sometimes you have a named opponent with enough narrative importance that you don't want them to go down too fast, even going against a balanced party by itself.<br>
When you want a single creature alone to be a good challenge for a regular 2-4 player party, you can give it the Aura of a Worthy Foe.
<br><br>

The Aura of a Worthy Foe grants it the following benefits:
+ It gains 10 Temporary HP for each player it is opposing when it enters an Action Scene.
+ While it has no allies in the current Action Scene, it takes two turns each round instead of one.

### Improvised Damage
We can use Level Dice to determine the power of situational damage dealt by the environment.<br>
1 for Mundane/Unlevelled -> d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 - d12 -> d20 for Cataclysmic/Beyond Levels.
<br><br>

One die is a painful but ultimately managable hit. Use it for effects that linger and trigger every turn, like breathing poison gas or standing on hot coals. Such effects could resonably be of a lower Level than the party and still provide an obsticle.
<br><br>

Two dice is some serious damage when not expected. Use it for effects that are only used once each, like a triggered bear trap or an exploding barrel of gunpowder. Such effects should be of the same Level as the party if the impact to *REALLY* be felt.
<br><br>

Three dice is a potentially lethal ordeal. Use it for catastrophic one-time events to avoid, like "bringing down the building" or "falling into the acid". Such effects could be of a higher Level than the party and saved as "the consequence of failure".
<br><br>

Regardless of the scale or severity, allow each target to make an appropriate Save to take half as much damage on a success. The Difficulty of such a Save should be equal to 10 + 2 * X.
