# Spellcasting
Spells are powerful and versatile abilities that can be learned inherently or found bound to enchanted objects. If a Spell forces a creature to make a Save, its Difficulty is equal to your Magic Might.

## Types of Spells
Each spell belongs to at least one Spell List, broadly explaining what type of mages can utilize them, and one Spell School, broadly categorizing what it can do.<br><br>

Spell List | Focus | Description
---: | :--- | :---
Arcane | An Arcane focus is meticulously crafted using potent materials, ranging from crystals to dragon bones. | Arcane Spells directly access the fabric of reality and tend towards being complexly specific.
Divine | A Divine Focus is a symbol evoking the ideals of a higher being, often depicted on other equipment. | Divine Spells call on higher powers to do the work and tend towards being simple and direct.
Primal | A Primal focus is a raw piece of potent material, often shaped to be used as equipment or accessories. | Primal Spells guide the world's natural flow of magic and tend towards being indirect and drawn out.

Spell Schools:<br>
+ **Abjuration:** Relates to protection or warding off other magic.
+ **Conjuration:** Relates to summoning or displacing creatures or objects.
+ **Divination:** Relates to gaining information.
+ **Enchantment:** Relates to manipulating or controlling minds.
+ **Evocation:** Relates to directing large amounts of pure magical energy.
+ **Illusion:** Relates to affecting or decieving the senses.
+ **Necromancy:** Relates to the forces of life, death, and the akward area between the two.
+ **Transmutation:** Relates to changing the properties and abilities of object and creatures.

For Example: *Spectral Weapon* belongs to the Conjuration Spell School, the Arcane Spell List, and the Divine Spell List. It can be referred to as "A Conjuration Spell", "An Arcane Spell", "A Divine Conjuration Spell", and more!

### Focuses
In order to attempt casting a Spell they know, the caster must use an item recognized as focus for at least one Spell List that the given Spell belongs to. To do so, the caster must be proficient with the type of Focus associated with that Spell List.
<br><br>

In order to attempt casting a Spell bound to magic item (like a scroll or a magic weapon), that item must allow the caster to use it as a focus. Whether there are any prerequisites the caster must meet and what those are is determined entirely by the item in question. If you're allowed, your focus proficiencies don't matter.<br>
Most commonly, an item will already have prerequisites defined for if a creature can attune to it and allow only an attuned wielder to use it as a focus to cast its bound Spells.

## Materials
If a Spell has a material component, the caster must have access to the listed items in order to begin their attempt to cast that Spell. If the listed items have a defined price, it reflect the combined quality and quantity needed for the material to qualify.<br>
If the material component is consumed, they are irretrievably lost once the Spell has been successful cast, and not a moment before.

## Begin Casting: Casting Time
Each spell has a given Casting Time it takes to create its effects, during which time the caster can't use its Actions on doing anything else. Attempting to cast any Spell is Interruptible, and taking any damage or being hit by any Attack during the Casting Time will do so.<br>
Interrupting a Spell with a Casting Time counted in Actions wastes all of those Actions. Interrupting a Spell with a longer Casting Time wastes all of the caster's current Actions, freeing it to regain them as normal at the end of its next turn.<br>

## Fishing Casting: Spending MP
Each Spell has a defined Base Cost. To successfully complete casting a Spell, an amount of MP no lower than its Base Cost must be spent. Upon finishing the Casting Time of a Spell, the caster can spend MP on the casting without using any additional Actions, up to an amount equal to its Mana Spend Limit.<br>
If an attempted casting fails for any reason, including if the MP spent on it isn't enough to cover its Base Cost, no MP is spent. Refunds!

### Casting Together
If a Spell is being cast within the Reach of a different creature that knows that Spell, it can use 1 Action at any point to join in on the casting. A creature stops being joined in it is Interrupted, following the normal rules for Interrupting the casting of a Spell, or if the caster is ever outside its reach. This does *NOT* Interrupt the original caster.<br>
When the Casting time is finished, each creature joined in the casting can spend MP in the same way as the caster does, but only the original caster decides the details of how the spell used.

### Potency & Empowerments
If more MP is spent on casting a Spell, its Potency increases. This could be useful in and of itself, but a lot of spells have a list of available Empowerments. To use one or more Empowerments, simply add their listed Cost to the Spell's Base Cost and apply each of their defined modifications to the Spell's effects.<br>
If an Empowerment has an "X" in its cost, you must choose a whole number value for X when you add it and use the same value for X in the description of its effect.

## Selecting Targets: Range & Area
T
<br><br>

**Ranges**<br>
+ **Self:** The range includes each space that you are occupying.
+ **Reach:** The range includes each space within your Reach.
+ **(X):** The range includes any space within X paces of any space you occupy.
####

**Areas**<br>
+ **Target:** The area is irrelevant. Knowing the Range is enough to determine the affected targets.
+ **Wall/Line? (X):** The spell affects X spaces on the battlemap. Each affected space must be connected to at least one other affected space by a full side. If the Spell's range is numerical, no affected space may be outside that range. Otherwise, at least one affected space must be included by the range.
+ **Burst/Blast? (X):** The spell affects each space in an X by X square on the battlemap. The square has a side length of X paces. If the Spell's range is numerical, no affected space may be outside that range. Otherwise, at least one affected space must be included by the range.

## Duration
After having successfuly cast a Spell, its effects linger for the given duration. As the caster, you may end it at any time?<br>
If the spell requires your Concentration to maintain, you start concentrating at the moment the duration starts. If your Concentration on the Spell breaks for any reason, the Spell ends, along with any effects that last for its duration.

### Concentration
When a creature begins concentrating on a new thing, whether or not it is a Spell, its current Stress is set to equal its Starting Stress.<br>
When a Concentrating creature takes damage, it must add the HP it lost to its Stress and make a Will Save against the new value.<br>
A creature can maintain Concentration on no more than one thing at a time.
