# Downtime Rules 
Not every part of a story needs to be covered step by step. <br>
In situations where we might want to skim over the details, allowing characters to recover and situations to change, we use downtime rules.

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time when there are no straineous activities going on. <br>
A creature or group of creatures can take a Rest to gain the following benefits up to once per day:<br>
+ Regain any spent uses for features that can be used X times per Rest.
+ Roll your Hit Die a number of times equal to your Level. For each die rolled, you regain lost HP your roll - your current Exhaustion.
#### <br>
A Rest taken to gain these benefits should be at least an hour long. <br>
If someone in the group makes a Check, casts a Spell, spends some feature resource, or takes any damage, the rest is interrupted for them, negating the benefits. <br>
If an entire party gets to Rest uninterrupted for full day, let the party fully recover instead: Restoring all HP and resources, including Spell Slots, and removing exhaustion.

## Food, Water, & Sleep
Creatures need food, water, and sleep to live properly. <br>
For each full day that passes for a creature, it should fulfill all of the following criteria: <br>
+ Eat a ration's worth of food (~5 cp - 5 sp). <br>
+ Drink a ??? worth of water or other refreshment(s). <br>
+ Sleep a night's worth of sleep. <br>
#### <br>
If a creature fails to fulfill any of these criteria, it must make an Endurance Test against a difficulty equal to 20 + its current Exhaustion. <br>
If it succeeds, it toughs it out without any adverse effects. If it fails, it gains 1 Exhaustion. <br>
This Test should be made before any Rest is taken.

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use any accomodation services, you need to specify how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in a more homely situation, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate Upkeep Cost each day per creature included. <br>
The Upkeep Cost includes the price of any necessary supplies or groceries, and/or the the salaries of anyone employed to manage said upkeep.
<br><br>
Lifestyle | Upkeep Cost | Service Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sp | A leaky stable, an infested, or an improvised mud-floored hut.
Poor | 2 sp | An unfurnished cabin, a Flophouse, or the common area of a greater establishment.
Modest | 5 sp | Inn, Temple, or a Boarding House.
Comfortable | 1 gp | A simple hotel room.
Wealthy | 5 gp | A luxurious suite with special perks.
Aristocratic | 10+ gp | Grand lodging, fine dining, and/or personal servants.

#### <br>
*As a GM guideline: The price of buying/selling a house is 100 times its Upkeep Cost, and the price of having one built is 1000 times its expected Upkeep Cost.*
