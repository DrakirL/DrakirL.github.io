## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time with there is no straineous activities going on. <br>
As a general guidline: If someone makes a Test, casts a Spell, spends some feature resource, or takes damage, it should *probably* not be considered a Rest.
After you finish a Rest you gain the following benefits: <br>
+ Regain any spent uses for features that can be used X times per Rest.
+ Roll your Hit Die up to a number of times equal to your level. You may replace your current HP with the rolled total, called your Rest HP. <br>
+ Reduce your Exhaustion by the number of times you chose to NOT roll Hit Dice when you determined your Rest HP. <br>

## Food, Water, & Sleep
You need a ration's worth of food (~5 cp - 5 sp) every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
You need a ??? worth of drink/water every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
You need a night's worth of sleep every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
The Difficulty for all these check = 10 + the number of days you've kept it up.

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use the services of a settlement, you need to specify how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in more homely situations, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate upkeep cost each day. <br>
