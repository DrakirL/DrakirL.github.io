# Downtime Rules 
Not every part of a story needs to be covered step by step.<br>
In situations where we might want to skim over the exact details of what everyone is doing, allowing settings and situations to change drastically, we use downtime rules.

## Basic Needs
Creatures need food, water, and sleep to live properly.<br>
For each full day that passes for a creature, it should fulfill all of the following criteria:
+ Eat a ration's worth of food (~5 cc - 5 sc).
+ Drink a flask's worth of water (~1 cc).
+ Sleep a night's worth of sleep.
#### <br>

For each of these criteria a creature fails to fulfill for a day, it must succeed on a Difficulty 10 Test of Endurance or gain 1 Exhaustion.<br>
*As a GM guideline: The sizes and prices of a "ration" or "flask" is assumed for a medium creature. To scale up, double them for each additional size value. To scale down, halve them for each subtracted size value*

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use any accomodation services, you need to explain how you get your nebasic needs met. But in a more homely situation, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate Upkeep Cost each day.<br>
The Upkeep Cost includes the price of any necessary supplies or services, as well as the the salaries of anyone employed to manage said upkeep.<br>
The Upkeep Cost must be paid for each creature partaking in the lifestyle.<br><br>

Lifestyle | Upkeep Cost | Service Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sc | A leaky stable, a mud-floored hut, or a literal hole in the wall.
Poor | 2 sc | An unfurnished cabin, a flophouse, or the common area of a greater establishment.
Modest | 5 sc | An inn, a temple, or a boarding house.
Comfortable | 1 gc | A simple hotel room.
Wealthy | 5 gc | A luxurious suite with special perks.
Aristocratic | 10+ gc | Grand lodging, fine dining, and/or personal servants.
#### <br>

*As a GM guideline: The price of a house (buying or selling) is 100 times its Upkeep Cost, and the cost to having one built is 1000 times its expected Upkeep Cost.*

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time when there are no straineous activities going on that a creature can gain benefits from.<br>
After a creature has rested for at least 1 shift, its Stress is set to equal its Standard Stress. If that creature has no exhaustion, it also regains HP equal to its HP Bonus and MP equal to its MP Bonus.<br>
If an ability allows you to do something "during a Rest" to create an effect, you can create no more than one of those effects per Rest.

### Breaking a Rest
Taking a Rest is an active choice and if one ends before a benefit can be gained, the opportunity to do so is lost.<br>
A creature doing any of the following will end its Rest:
+ Making an Attack
+ Making a Save
+ Taking any damage
+ Spending any MP
+ Travelling any greater distance as a non-passenger (PHRASING?)
+ Participating in any Activity that could be considered straineous.

### Long Rests
If a given Rest lasts for at least a full day, it counts as a "Long Rest".<br>
When a creature would regain HP and MP from finishing a Long Rest, instead set both to their respective maximum.<br>
After an Exhausted creature finishes a Long Rest, reduce its Exhaustion by 1.

## Activities
An Activity is a broadly defined task that takes more than a minute to finish, but is nonetheless summarized by a single Test of Skill.<br>
Multiple creatures can participate in any given Activity, each making its own Test against the same Difficulty, reflecting whatever they are doing to contribute to the completion of the task. The results of the efforts are determined by the combining the Degrees of Success from each participant.

### Pre-Defined Activities

#### Creating/Constructing/Forging?
The participants all work on a project to create something? Anything from regular clothes to potions to magical artifacts (PHRASING?). The required time is determined by the type of project. Could be a few minutes, could be several days worth of shifts.<br>
Requires the proper working environment (tools/workshop PHRASING?) and materials.
The difficulty is determined by the complexity of the project. Training with a relevant Occupation should grant Advantage.<br>
On a success, the item or items are successfully created. Each additional degree of success frees up 1 hour?

#### Exploring/Scouting?
The participants spread out and look for clues??? Takes an hour?<br>
The difficulty is determined by the intended Level of the area? Thievery Training should always grant Advantage?
On a success, the participants are given a full description of the explored area's layout and obvious points of interest. The degree of success determines any effects and situational benefits/penalties caused by the exploration, all contextually dependant.<br>
*EXAMPLES: A baseline success may reveal a pit-trap by having someone fall into it or add a bear to the scene by having someone wake it up. A high degree of success may reveal a hidden item by having someone notice a false wall or add a group of bandits to the scene by having someone sneak past their planned ambush undetected.*

#### Foraging/Hunting?
The participants collectively find, gather, and/or prepare food and drink to provide for their or other creatures' basic needs. Takes an hour.<br>
The difficulty is determined by the terrain of the area. Survival Training should always grant Advantage.<br>
On a success, the participants find and gather up to 1* portions of edible food or drinkable water (in any combination) large enough to meet the basic need for a creature of their Size. The aquired provisions may be consumed immidiately or stored, provided the appropriate means of storage are used (such as a "ration bag" for food or a "flask" for water).<br>

#### Researching
The participants collectively read documents, question people, and/or test theories to gain both specific and general information they didn't have before. Takes an hour.<br>
The difficulty is contextually dependant on where the information is being gathered from and the complexity of the information being searched for. Training in a relevant Education should grant Advantage.<br>
On a success, the GM will clearly and truthfully answer 1* questions about the subject that was researched.

#### Scavenging/Looting?
The participants collectively gather up. Takes an hour.<br>
The difficulty is ???. Thievery Training should alwats grant Advantage?<br>
On a success, the participants gather 1* individual pieces of available loot, whether they be coins from pockets, carriable objects from previous owners, or parts taken directly from the body of a creature.

#### Working
The participants all work a paid job with either given salaries or direct payments from the clients. Takes a shift.<br>
The difficulty is always 10? Training with a relevant Occupation should grant Advantage.<br>
On a success, the participants earn 1* coins of a type determined by the social standing of the job.<br>
