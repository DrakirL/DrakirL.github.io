# Downtime Rules 
???

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time with there is no straineous activities going on. <br>
As a general GM guidline: If someone makes a Test, casts a Spell, spends some feature resource, or takes damage, it should *probably* not be considered a Rest.
After you finish a Rest you gain the following benefits: <br>
+ Regain any spent uses for features that can be used X times per Rest.
+ Roll your Hit Die up to a number of times equal to your level. You may replace your current HP with the rolled total, called your Rest HP. <br>
+ Reduce your Exhaustion by the number of Hit Dice you chose to NOT roll when determining your Rest HP. <br>

## Food, Water, & Sleep
You need a ration's worth of food (~5 cp - 5 sp) every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
You need a ??? worth of drink/water every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
You need a night's worth of sleep every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
The Difficulty for all these Checks = 10 + the number of days you've kept it up. <br>
Each roll is separate, so if you're starving in a desert and refuse to sleep, you could gain up to 3 exhaustion in one day?

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use the services of a settlement, you need to specify how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in more homely situations, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate upkeep cost each day. <br>
<br>
Lifestyle | Cost/Day | Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sp | ??? 
Poor | 2 sp | ???
Modest | 5 sp | Inn, Temple, or Boarding House.
Comfortable | 1 gp | ???
Wealthy | 5 gp | A spacious home or luxurious suite.
Aristocratic | 10+ gp | The *grandest* lodging, *finest* dining, AND *most dignified* company. Servants are included.

# Grading Adventures: Levels
Your experience as an adventurer is represented by your Level; A rough scale meant to show how dangerous an adventure you could handle and how big the stakes could be if you fail. <br>
You can expect your party to have to fight at least 1 creature with a CR equal to your level by the time an adventure is finished. <br>
0-1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10+ ?
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Your friend! | Your home! | Your  | Your people! | Your kind! | Your world as you know it!
The whole building! | The whole town! | The Kingdom! | The entire kingdom! | The continent! | The universe itself!

## Character Progression
After you finish an Adventure, your character should be rewarded with significantly refreshing downtime and have gained significant experience, depending of the "level" of the adventure. <br>
At the very least, everyone should get a "long rest" where they regain all expending class resources, including things like Spell Slots that aren't regained on Rests. <br>
Then, the GM decides whether you characters should progress to a greater level, or if there are more stories to tell on the current scale. <br>
If it's the former, you level up! <br>
If it's the latter, you gain a feat with a level no higher than the adventure. <br>
With a generous GM running a campaign with fast scaling of stakes, you might get both at the same time.

### Feats
Your character can have up to 11 feats, because that's how many rows there are to write them on. <br>
Each row has a number, ranging from 0 to 10. You can't write down a feat with a level that is higher than the number on the line. <br>
If you feel like it, you can replace previously earned feats with a new one as you gain it (but with my campaign style, that shouldn't become necessary).
