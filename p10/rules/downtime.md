# Downtime Rules 
Not every part of a story needs to be covered step by step. <br>
In situations where we might want to skim over the details, allowing characters to recover and situations to change, we use downtime rules.

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time when there are no straineous activities going on that a creature can take no more than once per day.<br>
After a non-Exhausted creature has rested for at least 1 hour, it regains 1 HP and 1 MP.

### Breaking a Rest
Taking a Rest is an active choice and if one ends before a benefit can be gained, the opportunity to do so is lost.<br>
A creature doing any of the following will end its Rest:
+ Making an Attack
+ Making a Save
+ Making any Test using more than 1 Action? "Boosted" Test?
+ Taking any damage
+ Spending any MP
+ Travelling a mile, unless fully carried by another creature or vehicle (without driving or steering it).

### Long Rests
If a given Rest lasts for a full day, it counts as a "Long Rest".<br>
When a creature would regain HP and MP from finishing a Long Rest, instead set both to their respective maximum.<br>
After an Exhausted creature finishes a Long Rest, reduce its Exhaustion by 1.

## Food, Water, & Sleep
Creatures need food, water, and sleep to live properly.<br>
For each full day that passes for a creature, it should fulfill all of the following criteria:
+ Eat a ration's worth of food (~5 cc - 5 sc).<br>
+ Drink a flask's worth of water (~1 cc).<br>
+ Sleep a night's worth of sleep.<br>
#### <br>

For each of these criteria a creature fails to fulfill for a day, it must succeed on a Difficulty 10 Test of Endurance or gain 1 Exhaustion.

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use any accomodation services, you need to explain how you get your food/water/sleep etc. But in a more homely situation, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate Upkeep Cost each day.<br>
The Upkeep Cost includes the price of any necessary supplies or services, as well as the the salaries of anyone employed to manage said upkeep.<br>
The Upkeep Cost must be paid for each creature partaking in the lifestyle.<br><br>

Lifestyle | Upkeep Cost | Service Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sc | A leaky stable, a mud-floored hut, or a literal hole in the wall.
Poor | 2 sc | An unfurnished cabin, a flophouse, or the common area of a greater establishment.
Modest | 5 sc | An inn, a temple, or a boarding house.
Comfortable | 1 gc | A simple hotel room.
Wealthy | 5 gc | A luxurious suite with special perks.
Aristocratic | 10+ gc | Grand lodging, fine dining, and/or personal servants.

#### <br>
*As a GM guideline: The price of a house (buying or selling) is 100 times its Upkeep Cost, and the cost to having one built is 1000 times its expected Upkeep Cost.*

## Other Out of Combat Stuff

### Take a Breather
Any player character can sit down and do nothing for a minute and spend 1 MP to regain 1 HP.
