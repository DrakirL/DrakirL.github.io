# Downtime Rules 
???

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time when there are no straineous activities going on. A creature or group of creatures can take a Rest to gain the following benefits up to once per day:<br>
After you finish a Rest you gain the following benefits: <br>
+ Regain any spent uses for features that can be used X times per Rest.
+ Roll your Hit Die a number of times equal to your Level. For each die rolled, you regain lost HP your roll - your Exhaustion.
#### <br>
As a general GM guidline: If someone makes a Test, casts a Spell, spends some feature resource, or takes damage, it should *probably* not be considered a Rest.

## Food, Water, & Sleep
You need a ration's worth of food (~5 cp - 5 sp) every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain 1 Exhaustion. <br>
You need a ??? worth of drink/water every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
You need a night's worth of sleep every day. If a day passes without it, succeed on an Endurance Check or gain exhaustion. <br>
The Difficulty for all these Checks = 10 + the number of days you've kept it up. <br>
Each roll is separate, so if you're starving in a desert and refuse to sleep, you could gain up to 3 exhaustion in one day?

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use the services of a settlement, you need to specify how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in more homely situations, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate upkeep cost each day. <br>
<br>
Lifestyle | Cost/Day | Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sp | ??? 
Poor | 2 sp | ???
Modest | 5 sp | Inn, Temple, or Boarding House.
Comfortable | 1 gp | ???
Wealthy | 5 gp | A spacious home or luxurious suite.
Aristocratic | 10+ gp | The *grandest* lodging, *finest* dining, AND *most dignified* company. Servants are included.

# Grading Adventures: Levels
Your experience as an adventurer is represented by your Level; A rough scale meant to show how dangerous an adventure you could handle and how big the stakes could be if you fail. <br>
You can expect your party to have to fight at least 1 creature with a CR equal to your level by the time an adventure is finished. <br>
0-1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10+ ?
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Personal | Local | National | International | Global | Universal
Your family! | Your village! | Your country! | Your continent! | Your world! | Everything!
The whole building! | The whole city! | The whole Kingdom! | The whole realm! | Civilization as you know it! | Existence as you know it!

## Character Progression
After you finish an Adventure, your character should be rewarded with significantly refreshing downtime and have gained significant experience, depending of the "level" of the adventure. <br>
At the very least, everyone should get a "long rest" where they regain all or their lost HP and expended resources, including things like Spell Slots that can be used X times per Adventure. <br>
Then, the GM decides whether your characters should progress to a greater Level, or if there are more stories to tell on the current scale. <br>
Either way, each participant may jot down the finished adventure as an Experience/Saga/Tale/Memory/Feat?

### Feats? Experiences? Sagas? Tales? Memories?
On your sheet, you have space enough to write down what adventures your character has completed. A newly made character starts with one; their backstory. <br>
If you make a Test and fail, you may explain to the GM how the moment relates to one of your noted Sagas and why you MUST succeed. With the GM's permission, you may cross out the Tale to succeed on that Test instead. <br>
*How should used tales be regained? Per Adventure? Even less often? Special conditions?*
