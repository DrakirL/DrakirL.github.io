# Downtime Rules 
Not every part of a story needs to be covered step by step. <br>
In situations where we might want to skim over the details, allowing characters to recover and situations to change, we use downtime rules.

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time when there are no straineous activities going on. <br>
A creature can take a Rest to regain 1 HP and 1 MP, but no more than once per day. <br>
If a creature has any Exhaustion, it regains nothing. Instead, its exhaustion is reduced by 1.
<br><br>
A Rest taken to gain this benefit should be at least an hour long. <br>
Making an Attack or Save, casting a Spell, or taking any damage will interrupt an ongoing Rest, thus forgoing the benefit.
<br>
*"LONG REST": If a Rest lasts for a full day, regain 1 additional HP and MP for each full day's Rest that has passed in a row (starting total: 2 HP, 2 MP). You still regain nothing if you're exhausted, but the streak still counts!*

## Food, Water, & Sleep
Creatures need food, water, and sleep to live properly. <br>
For each full day that passes for a creature, it should fulfill all of the following criteria: <br>
+ Eat a ration's worth of food (~5 cc - 5 sc). <br>
+ Drink a flask's worth of water (~1 cc). <br>
+ Sleep a night's worth of sleep. <br>
#### <br>
If a creature fails to fulfill any of these criteria for a day, it must make an Endurance Test against a difficulty equal to its Base Stress + its current Exhaustion. <br>
If it succeeds, it toughs it out without any adverse effects. If it fails, it gains 1 Exhaustion. <br>
This Test should be made before any Rest is taken.

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use any accomodation services, you need to specify how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in a more homely situation, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate Upkeep Cost each day per creature included. <br>
The Upkeep Cost includes the price of any necessary supplies or groceries, as well as the the salaries of anyone employed to manage said upkeep.
<br><br>
Lifestyle | Upkeep Cost | Service Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sc | A leaky stable, an infested, or an improvised mud-floored hut.
Poor | 2 sc | An unfurnished cabin, a Flophouse, or the common area of a greater establishment.
Modest | 5 sc | Inn, Temple, or a Boarding House.
Comfortable | 1 gc | A simple hotel room.
Wealthy | 5 gc | A luxurious suite with special perks.
Aristocratic | 10+ gc | Grand lodging, fine dining, and/or personal servants.

#### <br>
*As a GM guideline: The price of a house (buying or selling) is 100 times its Upkeep Cost, and the cost to having one built is 1000 times its expected Upkeep Cost.*
