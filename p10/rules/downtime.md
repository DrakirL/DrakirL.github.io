# Downtime Rules 
???

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time with there is no straineous activities going on. <br>
As a general guidline: If someone makes a Test, casts a Spell, spends some feature resource, or takes damage, it should *probably* not be considered a Rest.
After you finish a Rest you gain the following benefits: <br>
+ Regain any spent uses for features that can be used X times per Rest.
+ Roll your Hit Die a number of times equal to your level. You may replace your current HP with the rolled total? <br>
OR... Roll Hit Die, regain that much HP?
+ Roll your Hit Die. Reduce your exhaustion by an amount equal to the number rolled (down to 0)? <br>
OR... reduce Exhaustion by number of HP regained (Relevant only if regain = 1 roll)?

## Food, Water, & Sleep
You need 1 Ration worth of food (~5 cp - 5 sp) every day. If a day passes without it, make a Save or gain exhaustion.
You need 1 ??? worth of drink/water every day. If a day passes without it, make a Save or gain exhaustion.
You need ??? of sleep every day. If a day passes without it, make a Save or gain exhaustion.

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use the services of a settlement, you need to specify how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in more homely situations, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate upkeep cost each day.

Squalid | <1 sp | ??? 
Poor | 2 sp | ???
Modest | 5 sp | Inn, Temple, or Boarding House.
Comfortable | 1 gp | ???
