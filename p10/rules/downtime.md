# Downtime Rules 
Not every part of a story needs to be covered step by step. <br>
In situations where we might want to skim over the details, allowing characters to recover and situations to change, we use downtime rules.

## Rests
A Rest is a prolonged period of time when there are no straineous activities going on. A creature can rest for at least 1 hour to regain 1 HP and 1 MP.<br>
If a Rest lasts for a full day, the resting creature is restored to its maximum HP and MP instead. This is called a Long Rest.<br>
Making an Attack or Save, casting a Spell, or taking any damage will interrupt an ongoing Rest, thus forgoing the benefit.<br>
This benefit cannot be gained more than once per day, and a Rest taken to do so should be at least an hour long.<br>
A creature that has any Exhaustion cannot regain any HP or MP from resting. Instead, its exhaustion is reduced by 1.
<br><br>

## Food, Water, & Sleep
Creatures need food, water, and sleep to live properly. <br>
For each full day that passes for a creature, it should fulfill all of the following criteria: <br>
+ Eat a ration's worth of food (~5 cc - 5 sc). <br>
+ Drink a flask's worth of water (~1 cc). <br>
+ Sleep a night's worth of sleep. <br>
#### <br>
For each of these criteria a creature fails to fulfill for a day, it must succeed on a Difficulty 10 Endurance Test or gain 1 Exhaustion.

### Abstractions
If you are in the middle of nowhere, or choosing to not use any accomodation services, you need to explain how you get your food/water/sleep etc. <br>
But in a more homely situation, you may assume they are all accounted for by spending money on an approximate Upkeep Cost each day. <br>
The Upkeep Cost includes the price of any necessary supplies or services, as well as the the salaries of anyone employed to manage said upkeep. <br>
The Upkeep Cost must be paid for each creature partaking in the lifestyle.
<br><br>
Lifestyle | Upkeep Cost | Service Example
:---|:---|:---
Squalid | 1 sc | A leaky stable, a mud-floored hut, or a literal hole in the wall.
Poor | 2 sc | An unfurnished cabin, a flophouse, or the common area of a greater establishment.
Modest | 5 sc | An inn, a temple, or a boarding house.
Comfortable | 1 gp | A simple hotel room.
Wealthy | 5 gp | A luxurious suite with special perks.
Aristocratic | 10+ gp | Grand lodging, fine dining, and/or personal servants.

#### <br>
*As a GM guideline: The price of a house (buying or selling) is 100 times its Upkeep Cost, and the cost to having one built is 1000 times its expected Upkeep Cost.*

## Other Out of Combat Stuff

### Take a Breather
Any player character can sit down and do nothing for a minute and spend 1 MP to regain 1 HP.
