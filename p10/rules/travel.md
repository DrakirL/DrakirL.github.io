# Travel Rules 
???

## Tests
A party can spend an hour to travel to a different location up to 5 miles away. (Distance determined by Speed or do horses have a special ability)? <br>
If you wish to do things on the way you may if they are easy enough <br>
A creature can travel up to 8 miles in a day without any averse effects? <br>
If a creature keeps travelling, it must succeed on an Endurance Check? with a Difficulty equal to the number of hours travelled that day, every hour, gaining 1 Exhaustion on a failed Save. <br>
Gaining 6 Exhaustion could kill you, or at least "take you out". Either way, you're putting your character's fate in the GM's hands in the middle of nowhere without being able to use any abilities. You don't wanna do that.
