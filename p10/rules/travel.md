# Travel Rules 
A party of creatures can spend an hour to travel to a location within a neighbouring hex-space, aka "1 league away". <br>
You may to partake in some activity whilst travelling, such as gathering food, keeping watch, or entertaining the group. But each travelling adventurer may only do one such activity per hour travelled. <br>
A creature can travel this way for up to 8 hours in a given day without any adversery effects. <br>
For each additional hour a creature travels beyond that limit, it must succeed on an Endurance Test or gain 1 Exhaustion. The Difficulty of such a Test is equal to the total number of hours travelled that day. <br>
*REMINDER: By overexerting yourself, you could be putting your character's fate in the GM's hands in the middle of nowhere without being able to use any abilities. Hot Tip - You probably don't wanna do that.*

## Outside Conditions
Difficult terrain is a thing. What takes 1 hour to do in normal terrain takes 2 in particularily difficult areas. Said areas may also have additional effects.<br>
Weather might be bad, especially extreme temperatures. This imposes disadvantage on any test made to avoid Exhaustion from overexertion.<br>

## Mounts & Vehicles
The number of leagues a creature or vehicle can cover per hour is increased by 1 for each Size it is over Medium. (PHRASING?) <br>
When a party consisting of travellers of various Sizes, it must stick to the pace of its smallest member. This can be circumvented by riding the larger creatures. (PHRASING?)

# Carrying Capacity
Every creature has room to carry equipment with them in an Inventory, which is kept track of through "slots" placed in a grid with dimensions determined by the creature's Size. A miniscule creature has no slots in its grid, and a colossal creature has unlimited slots. For all other sizes, it has 6 rows and a number of columns equal to the creature's Size Value<br>
*Each slot can only carry 1 item that could be reasonably carried, or up to 10 "petty" items in a single slot.
<br><br>
In addition to these general spaces, every creature has 3 additional spaces reserved for items of a certain type: Clothes, Accessories, and Coins.<br>
Coins are a special case. You can carry as many as you want in this dedicated slot, provided they are of the "standardized currency".

## Encumberence
Each row in a creature's Inventory has a number. If it carries an item in a slot on a row with a number greater than its Strength, it is Encumbered.<br>
When an Encumbered creature regains its actions in an Action Scene, it must drop enough of its inventory for it to no longer be encumbered and/or use 1 Action to keep its bearings.<br>
Whilst travelling, an Encumbered creature can't partake in any travelling activities (or automatically fail if it tries anyways).

## "Used Hands"
It doesn't matter if or how you are using an item. If it comes with you as you move, it is in your inventory and needs to be accounted for.<br>
You must be somehow holding/wielding an item (in your right hand, left hand, mouth, etc) in order to use it, unless otherwise specified. (PHRASING?)<br>
You can't be using more than one item in the same way (Can't wield a bow and a sword with the same hand). (PHRASING?)
