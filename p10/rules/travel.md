# Travel Rules 
???

## Tests
A party can travel up to 1 mile in 1 hour? <br>
A creature can travel up to 8 miles in a day without any averse effects? <br>
If a creature keeps travelling, it must succeed on a Fortitude Save with a Difficulty equal to the number of hours travelled that day, every hour, gaining 1 Exhaustion on a failed Save. <br>
Gaining 6 Exhaustion could kill you, or at least "take you out". Either way, you're putting your character's fate in the GM's hands in the middle of nowhere without being able to use any abilities. You don't wanna do that.
