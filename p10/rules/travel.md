# Travel Rules 
A creature can spend a shift to travel through a number of hex-spaces, up to a distance (measured in leagues) equal to its Size Value. A group of creatures can travel together as a single conhesive unit called a party. If a party consists of members that could travel at different paces, it must stick to the slowest pace amongst them in order to remain a party.<br><br>

Each creature that travels this way must make a Test of Endurance afterwards. The difficulty of the Test is equal to 5 times the number of times that creature has travelled since its last Rest. A creature that fails this test gains 1 Exhaustion.<br>
*REMINDER: If you gain too much Exhaustion, you put your character's fate in the GM's hands, even if you're in the middle of nowhere. Hot Tip - You probably don't wanna do that.*

## Passengers
Whilst travelling, one or more of a party's members may be moved along without any active effort on their part. Usually this is caused by a larger creature carrying them, or them riding along with a vehicle. Any creature being moved this way is considered a "passenger".<br>
Passengers aren't considered when determining the party's travelling pace, and no passenger needs to make any Test of Endurance.

### Vehicles
**Dragged Carts:** A cart can be dragged behind any creature no smaller than itself and carry however many creatures can fit within its space without slowing down the creature dragging it.<br>
In order to travel with a cart, one creature must be dragging it over an existing road. If that creature isn't fit to steer the cart on its own, different creature can steer that creture (forgoing passenger status).<br><br>

**Sailing Ships:** A ship can travel freely across open water whilst carrying crew, cargo, and/or passengers. Steering a ship requires 1 helmsman, 1 navigator, and a number of active shipmen equal it its Size Value.


## Outside Conditions

### Difficult Terrain
If the environment of a hex-space is filled with non-flat ground, tightly packed obsticles, or other comparable inconveniences, it can be considered Difficult Terrain.<br>
If the party is within a hex-space of Difficult Terrain, each of its members is affected by said Terrain. This can result in a plethora of effects depending on the terrain and the source of its difficulty, but it will at least hinder the party's travelling pace.<br>
In order for a travelling party to move whilst hindered by Difficult Terrain, it must use 2 leagues of movement to move 1 league, which may be done over multiple shifts. (PHRASING?)<br>
*(To clarify: Getting into Difficult Terrain is supposed to be easy. It has no effect until you're already in. But once you're in, the effects are applied mid movement.)*

### Terrible Weather
The weather of any given hex-space or route through them may change from one shift to the next. At the GM's dicretion (or perhaps intentionally caused by some in-game event or entity), the weather could be bad enough to increase the Difficulty of any Test of Endurance made after travelling through it.<br>
There are many different types of weather that each carry their own additional effects and/or ways of circumventing their difficulties. Which ones might naturally appear depends on the surrounding environment.

#### Bad Air Quality
Catch all term for any issues that makes breathing harder without causing direct suffocation. Could be caused by thin air at high altitudes, staleness in enclosed spaces, or stuffiness due to thick mist or natural gases. Increases the Test's difficulty by 5.<br>
A creature that makes a Test to hold its breath in such conditions gains Disadvantage on its Test.

#### Extreme Cold
Most commonly found in Arctic environments. Increases the Test's difficulty by 5, which is reduced by a creature's Cold Resistance. This increase also applies to any Test made to avoid Exhaustion from not eating food.<br>
Creatures that spend time within Extreme Cold must make a Test of Endurance after every shift, even when they don't travel. Only travelling raises the base difficulty.<br>
A creature that isn't wearing any appropriate clothing (such as an insulating hide or thick furs, including what they've grown on their own) gains Disadvantage on its Test.

#### Extreme Heat
Most commonly found in Desert environments. Increases the Test's difficulty by 5, which is reduced by a creature's Fire Resistance. This increase also applies to any Test made to avoid Exhaustion from not drinking water.<br>
Creatures that spend time within Extreme Cold must make a Test of Endurance after every shift, even when they don't travel. Only travelling raises the base difficulty.<br>
A creature that's wearing too much unfit clothing (such as heavy armor or thick furs, including what they've grown on their own) gains Disadvantage on any Test modified by this.

## Encounters
As a party travels from one location to another, it is likely that they should encounter some source of challenge and/or interest on the way. The GM has a lot of leeway when creating encounters, able to design some in advance and make some up on the spot, or decide that some will happen at specific points and have random chance determine when/what others occur.<br>
Whatever the preferred method are used, put some thought into what Examples include:
+ **A Forced Combat Encounter!** Monsters or enemies could set up ambushes or blockades in basically any type of terrain, but what creatures are willing to do that depends on their surroundings.
+ **A Chance Social Encounter!** There is always more than one travelling party moving around the world somewhere, especially on existing roads. Curious characters such as merchants, journeymen, or other adventurers may take the opportunity to interact as you pass by each other.
+ **Issues Whilst Navigating!** When travelling through uncharted areas, the greatest challenge might be to arrive at the intended destinastion. Force the party to partake in an Activity to try and avoid getting lost. Survival Training helps.
+ **Issues With Outside Conditions!** The forces of nature can be unpredictable and suddenly create Difficult Terrain, Terrible Weather, or both. When a situation like this is sudden and/or harsh enough, you can treat it as the encountered challenge for that journey.
+ **Unexpected Points of Interest** Some points of interest may be revealed only as a party stumbles upon them unintentionally. It could be as small as a hidden cache or the remains of another traveller, or as large as an isolated hidaway or the entrance to a vast cave system. Let the travellers decide how they approach what they find and let the context determine the nature of the scene. It could end up being an Action Scene, a social encounter, a long term Exploration Activity, a quick stop with to pick up a neat item, or maybe even a combination of them all! If enough time in spent on the encounter, let it become the journey's new destination.
### <br>

Regardless of the type of the encounter, the time it takes to fully deal with it is included into the shift's traveling time (PHRASING?). A party should be presented with no more than a single encounter of any type for each shift they spend travelling. 

# Carrying Capacity
Every creature has room to carry equipment with them in an Inventory, which is kept track of through "slots" placed in a grid with dimensions determined by the creature's Size. A miniscule creature has no slots in its grid, and a colossal creature has unlimited slots. For all other sizes, it has 6 rows and a number of columns equal to the creature's Size Value<br>
*Each slot can only carry 1 item that could be reasonably carried, or up to 10 "petty" items in a single slot.<br><br>

In addition to these general spaces, every creature has 3 additional spaces reserved for items of a certain type: Clothes, Accessories, and Coins.<br>
Coins are a special case. You can carry as many as you want in this dedicated slot, provided they are of the "standardized currency".

## Encumberence
Each row in a creature's Inventory has a number. If it carries an item in a slot on a row with a number greater than its Strength, it is Encumbered.<br>
When an Encumbered creature regains its actions in an Action Scene, it must drop enough of its inventory for it to no longer be encumbered and/or use 1 Action to keep its bearings.

## "Used Hands"
It doesn't matter if or how you are using an item. If it comes with you as you move, it is in your inventory and needs to be accounted for.<br>
You must be somehow holding/wielding an item (in your right hand, left hand, mouth, etc) in order to use it, unless otherwise specified. (PHRASING?)<br>
You can't be using more than one item in the same way (Can't wield a bow and a sword with the same hand). (PHRASING?)
