# Travel Rules 
A party of creatures can spend an hour to travel to a location within a neighbouring hex-space, aka "1 league away". <br>
You may to partake in some activity whilst travelling, such as gathering food, keeping watch, or entertaining the group. But each travelling adventurer may only do one such activity per hour travelled. <br>
A creature can travel this way for up to 8 hours in a given day without any averse effects. <br>
If a creature keeps travelling beyond that limit, it must make an Endurance Test with a Difficulty equal to the number of hours travelled that day, every hour, gaining 1 Exhaustion on a failed Save. <br>
Gaining 6 Exhaustion could kill you (or at least "take you out"), just like it does in combat. By overexerting yourself, you could be putting your character's fate in the GM's hands in the middle of nowhere without being able to use any abilities. Hot Tip: You generally don't wanna do that.

## Outside Conditions
Difficult terrain is a thing. What takes 1 hour to do in normal terrain takes 2 in particularily difficult areas. Said areas may also have additional effects. <br>
Weather might be bad, especially extreme temperatures. <br>

## Mounts & Vehicles
The number of leagues a creature or vehicle can cover per hour is increased by 1 for each Size it is over Medium. (PHRASING?) <br>
When a party consisting of travellers of various Sizes, it must stick to the pace of its smallest member. (PHRASING?)

# Carrying Capacity
Every creature has room to carry equipment with them in an Inventory, which is kept track of through "slots" (PHRASING?). The amount of inventory space a creature has is based on its size (Tiny = 1 Column. Small = 2 Columns. Medium = 3 Columns. Large = 4 Columns. Huge = 5 Columns). A miniscule creature has no "slots". A colossal creature has unlimited slots. <br>
*Each column has 6 Spaces. 1 is free, the rest are numbered 1-5.<br>
*Each space can only carry 1 item that could be reasonably carried, or up to 10 "petty" items in a single slot.
<br><br>
In addition to these spaces, every creature has 5 additional spaces reserved for the items it is currently wearing.<br>
Each of these slots is restricted to items of a certain type: Clothes, Armor, Accessories, Containers, and Coins.<br>
Coins are a special case. You can carry as many as you want in this dedicated slot, provided they are "standardized currency".

## Encumberence
If a creature is carrying more things than its Strength would allow for, it is Encumbered.<br>
When an Encumbered creature regains its actions in combat, it must either drop enough of its inventory for it to no longer be encumbered or use 1 Action to keep its bearings.<br>
During travelling, an Encumbered creature can't partake in any travelling activities (and/or automatically fail if it tries).

## "Used Hands"
It doesn't matter if or how you are using an item. If it comes with you as you move, it is in your inventory and needs to be accounted for.<br>
To use an item however (unless it can be used whilst worn), you must be holding/wielding it somehow (in your right hand, left hand, mouth, etc). You can't be using more than one item in the same way (Can't wield a bow and a sword with the same hand). (*PHRASING?)
