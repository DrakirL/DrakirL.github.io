# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value no higher than 40, often predetermined and noted on some character's sheet. <br>
In cases where a value has not been determined, the GM can pick a value on the spot, typically 10, 15, or 20. <br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Trivial | Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Intense | Formidable | Legendary | Essentially Impossible

#### <br>
Then, the creature being tested rolls a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. <br>
Because Tests are made when success and failure are both equally acceptable outcomes, rolling a natural 1 is always a failure and a natural 20 is always a success. <br>
If you are forced to make a Test, you can always choose to fail if so wish.

## Attribute/Skill Bonuses
You will essentially never be asked to just "make a Test" without any additional information. <br>
Instead, the instructions will specify more information regarding the Test's Attribute, Skill, and/or Type. For example: "Make a Charisma Test", "Make a Martial Attack", "Make an Acrobatics Check?", "Make an Intelligence Save".
<br><br>
If you make a Test with a specified Attribute (for example a "Strength Save"), you add the value you have for that Attribute to your roll. <br>
If you make a Test with a specified Skill (for example a "Tolerance Check"), you add the values you have for that Skill AND the Attrubute the Skill is based on to your roll. <br>

### Types of Tests
Tests are often referred to with other names to designate the Type. Tests are performed in the exact same way regardless of their type (Fail if roll is lower than Difficulty, succeed if roll equal or higher), but these names explains the context where certain Tests are often made. They also act as identifiers, which may make them elligable for special features/benefits that don't apply to ALL Tests, only ones of a specific type.
<br><br>
**Attacks**<br>
Attacks are Tests that you make when you are trying to harm a creature or damage an object.
The Difficulty of the Test is determined by target's Defence (or Hardness if it's an inanimate object?).
On a success, you've landed a decent hit against the target, dealing damage and/or triggering any effects that occur on a hit. <br>
Attacks are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill.
<br><br>
**Checks**<br>
Checks are Tests that you make to see if some defined task sits within your skillset, provided you spend the time needed to try using any required tools. <br>
On a success, you will successfully complete the defined task to whatever degree is reasonable in the given context. After succeeding, you will not be forced to retry the same Check just to maintain the result. <br>
On a fail, you suffer whatever the consequences of a failure would be in the given context. After failing, you may not retry the same Check in the same context. <br>
Checks will always specify a Skill, usually one that is bound by an Attribute.
<br><br>
**Saves**<br>
Saves are Tests that you are *forced* to make by some external influence actively attempting to directly hit/affect you with some kind of effect. <br>
The Difficulty of the Test should be pre-determined by the source's Passive Skills. <br>
On a success, the incoming effect may be negated (or at least partially mitigated). On a fail, you suffer the full extend of the effect. <br>
Saves prefer to specify an Attribute rather than a specific Skill. Save bonus?

### Increasing Bonuses: Skill Points.
As a base, your Skill Bonus for every Skill is 0. You increase them by spending Skill Points (1 Skill Point spent on a Skill = +1 to your Skill Bonus for that Skill). <br>
You can't increase either of the two Adventuring Skills, Martial & Magic, to be higher than your Level, and no Skill to be higher than 10. Exceptions to these rules have to be specified by features! <br>
You gain Skill Points to spend in a variety of ways, including from your Background and at each Class Level. If you would gain enough Skill Points in a specific Skill to exeed its limit, you may redistribute the excess as you wish between your other Skills. <br>

## Advantage & Disadvantage
The surrounding circumstances for a Test may be either helpful or hurtful. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that could reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that could reasonably impede the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

## Proficiency & Training
Sometimes you can be more than just skilled, and sometimes merely being skilled is not enough to gain a benefit.
### Proficiency: Weapons, Shields, & Armor.
If you lack Proficiency with a type weapon, you may not add your Martial Skill to any Attack you make using a weapon of that type. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of armor, your speed is halved and you can't cast Spells while you're wearing it. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of shield, you can't use a shield of that type to increase your Defence. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of focus, you can't use a focus of that type to cast spells. <br>
### Training: Occupations, Educations, Vehicles, Games, and Instruments.
If you have any Training in some area, ham it up! If you can describe how your training would help you make a Check, you gain Advantage on that Check for free! <br>
*Examples: Gain adventage on a Performance Check by playing an instrument you've practiced, on a Handling Check for controlling a machine you've worked with regularily, or on a Lore Check regarding a subject you are educated in.*

# Spellcasting
To cast a Spell, you need to be holding a focus. If the Spell is contained within an item (like a scroll or magic weapon), that item doubles as the focus. <br>
If you know a Spell by yourself, you must use a special item that works as a focus for one of the Spell Lists the Spell in question belongs to. To use such a focus this way, you must be Proficient with it. <br>
If a Spell forces a Save to be made, the Difficulty for that Save is equal to the caster's Passive Magic Skill.

## Spell Slots
If you know a Spell, you can cast it by expending a Spell Slot of a Rank no lower that the Spell's Rank. <br>
If you cast a Spell by expending a Spell Slot of a greater Rank than is needed, the Spell's Rank increases to match (which matters for Counterspell etc). A lot of Spells also have additional benefits if cast at greater Ranks, keep an eye out for those! <br>
You regain any expended Spell Slots after you finish an adventure (aka Long Rest?).

### Cantrips
If a Spell has the "Cantrip"-tag, it is really simple and non-taxing to cast compared to other spells of that Rank. <br>
If you know a Cantrip Spell, you can cast that Spell without using a focus or expending a Spell Slot.
