# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value, typically 10, 15, or 20. <br>
The value will often be predetermined and already written on someone's character sheet. If it isn't, the GM can pick a value on the spot <br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Trivial | Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Formidable | Essentially Impossible

#### <br>
Then, the charcter being tested rolls a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. <br>
Because Tests are made when success and failure are both equally acceptable outcomes, rolling a natural 1 is always a failure and a natural 20 is always a success. <br>
If you are forced to make a Test, you can always choose to fail if so wish.

## Attribute/Skill Bonuses
You will essentially never be asked to just "make a Test" without any additional information. <br>
Instead, the instructions will specify more information regarding the Test's Attribute, Skill, and/or Type. For example: "Make a Charisma Test", "Make a Martial Attack", "Make an Acrobatics Check?", "Make an Intelligence Save".
<br><br>
If you make a Test with a specified Attribute (for example a "Strength Save"), you add the value you have for that Attribute to your roll. <br>
If you make a Test with a specified Skill (for example a "Tolerance Check"), you add the value you have for that Skill to your roll. <br>

### Types of Tests
Tests are often referred to with other names to designate the Type. They are performed in the exact same way (Fail if roll is lower than Difficulty, succeed if roll equal or higher), but these names explains the context where certain Tests are often made. They also act as identifiers, which may make them allegable for special features/benefits that don't apply to ALL Tests, only ones of a specific type.

**Attacks**<br>
Attacks are Tests that you make when you are trying to harm a creature or damage an object.
The Difficulty of the Test is determined by target's Defence (or Hardness if it's an inanimate object).
On a success, you've landed a decent hit against the target, dealing it damage. The amount of damage dealt is determined by the weapon/spell used to attack. If you're just using your fists, it's 1, but you may choose to Grapple or Shove the target instead. <br>
Attacks are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill.

**Checks**<br>
Checks are Tests that you make to see if some task sits within your skillset. (PHRASING?) <br>
On a success, you will successfully complete the task, however long it happens to take, provided you're using the right tools/materials. On a fail, you suffer whatever the consequences of failure are in the given context. <br>
For example: The time or resources used to attempt crafting an item could be wasted. That glass of poisoned wine is too much, so you take Poison damage and fall unconscious. The bartender may not let you question him any further until you change your approach. <br>
Checks will specify a Skill much more often than an Attribute.

**Saves**<br>
Saves are Tests that you are *forced* to make by some external influence actively attempting to directly hit/affect you with some kind of effect. <br>
The Difficulty of the Test should be pre-determined by the source's Passive Skills. <br>
On a success, the incoming effect may be negated (or at least partially mitigated). On a fail, you suffer the full extend of the effect. <br>
Saves prefer to specify an Attribute rather than a specific Skill.

### Increasing Bonuses: Skill Points.
As a base, your Skill Bonus for every Skill is 0. You increase them by spending Skill Points (1 Skill Point spent on a Skill = +1 to your Skill Bonus for that Skill). <br>
Your Skill Bonus for each Skill is limited by your capabilities! You can't increase an Attribute-based Skill to be higher than that Attribute, and you can't increase either of the Adventuring Skills, Martial & Magic, to be higher than your Level. Exceptions to this rule have to be specified by features! <br>
You gain Skill Points to spend in a variety of ways, including from your Background and at each Class Level. If you would gain enough Skill Points in a specific Skill to exeed its limit, you may redistribute the excess as you wish between your other Skills. <br>

## Advantage & Disadvantage
The surrounding circumstances for a Test may be either helpful or hurtful. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that reasonably impede the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

## Proficiency & Training
Sometimes you can be more than just skilled, and sometimes merely being skilled is not enough to gain a benefit.
### Proficiency: Weapons, Shields, & Armor.
If you lack Proficiency with a type weapon, you may not add your Martial Skill to any Attack you make using a weapon of that type. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of armor, your speed is halved and you can't cast Spells while you're wearing it. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of shield, it does not help increase your Defence. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of focus, you can't use a focus of that type to cast spells. <br>
### Training: Tools?, Vehicles, Games, Instruments, & Education
If you have any Training in some area, ham it up! If you can describe how your training would help you make a Check, you gain Advantage on that Check for free! <br>
*Examples: Gain adventage on a Performance Check by playing an instrument you've practiced, on a Handling Check for controlling a machine you've designed, or on a Lore Check regarding a subject you are educated in.*

# Spellcasting
To cast a Spell, you need to be holding a focus. If the Spell is contained within an item (like a scroll or magic weapon), that item doubles as the focus. If you know the Spell yourself, you must hold a special item that works as a focus for one Spell List that Spell belongs to.
If a Spell forces a Save to be made, the Difficulty of that Save is equal to the caster's Passive Magic Skill. A lot of Spells might require Magic Checks or Magic Attacks, but those are self-explanatory. <br>

## Spell Slots
If you know a Spell, you can cast it by expending a Spell Slot of a Rank no lower that the Spell's Rank. <br>
If you cast a Spell by expending a Spell Slot of a greater Rank than is needed, the Spell's Rank increases to match (which matters for Counterspell etc). A lot of Spells also have additional benefits if cast at greater Ranks, keep an eye out for those! <br>
You regain any expended Spell Slots after you finish an adventure (aka Long Rest?).

### Cantrips
If a Spell has the "Cantrip"-tag, it is really simple and non-taxing to cast compared to other spells of that Rank. <br>
If you know a Cantrip Spell, you can cast that Spell without using a focus or expending a Spell Slot.
