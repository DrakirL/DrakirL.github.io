# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value no higher than 35, often predetermined and noted on some involved character's sheet. <br>
In cases where a value has not been determined, the GM can pick a value on the spot, typically 10, 15, or 20. <br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Trivial | Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Formidable | Legendary | Impossible (NOT FOR USE)

#### <br>
Then, the creature being tested rolls a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. You can also choose to fail a Test, if so wish.<br>
Because Tests are made when either a success or failure would be an acceptable outcome, rolling a natural 1 is always a failure and a natural 20 is always a success. <br>

## Attributes/Skill Bonuses
You will essentially never be asked to just "make a Test" without any additional information. <br>
Instead, the instructions will specify more information regarding the Check's Attribute or Skill. For example: "Test of Strength", "Test of Acrobatics", "Martial Attack", or "Magic Intelligence Save".
<br><br>
If you make a Check with a specified Attribute (for example a "Martial Strength Save"), you add the value you have for that Attribute to your roll. <br>
If you make a Check with a specified Skill (for example a "Test of Brawn" or "Martial Agility Attack"), you add the values you have for that Skill AND the Attribute the Skill is listed under on to your roll. <br>

### Named Types of Tests: Attacks & Saves
Tests can be referred to with other names to designate a specific type, but all types of Tests are performed in the exact same way: Roll a d20, add modifiers, compare to difficulty. <br>
These names do not affect the Test's function, but is only meant to explain the context where certain Checks are often made. There are however certain features/benefits that exclude or excludingly include which Tests they apply to based on these names.
<br><br>
**Attacks**<br>
An Attack is a Test made to land a hit on a creature or break an object.<br>
The Difficulty of the Test is generally determined by target's Defence (or "Hardness" if it's inanimate).<br>
On a success, you land a decent hit on the target, dealing damage and/or triggering any effects that occur on a hit.<br>
Attacks are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill, but often don't specify an Attribute (meaning that you get to pick one of the appropriate two).
<br><br>
**Saves**<br>
A Save is a Test that you are *forced* to make by some external influence. As such, you don't decide when to attempt them and don't need to use any Actions to do so.<br>
The Difficulty of the Test is often pre-determined by one of the source's Passive Skills, but may also be improvised by the GM on occation. <br>
On a success, the incoming effect may be negated (or at least partially mitigated). On a fail, you suffer the full extend of the effect. <br>
Saves are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill, usually with a specified Attribute.

### Increasing Bonuses: Skill Points.
You have a defined Grade for each of your Skills. The bonus you apply to any Test that uses a Skill is equal to two times your Grade for that given Skill. <br>
At each level, you gain a number of Skill Points determined by your Class. You can use each point to increase your Grade for a given Skill by 1, up to a maxmimum of 5. You cannot use more than 1 Skill Point on the same Skill at any given Level.

## Advantage & Disadvantage
When a Test is made, the surrounding context and circumstances may be either helpful or hurtful to it. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that could reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that could reasonably reduce the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
There are no additional effects if a Test could use multiple sources of Advantage or Disadvantage. Only one of each counts. <br>
If a Test is made with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

## Proficiency & Training
Sometimes you can be more than just skilled, and sometimes merely being skilled is not enough to gain a benefit or avoid a penalty.
### Proficiency: Weapons, Shields, & Armor.
If you lack Proficiency with a type of weapon, you gain Disadvantage on any Test made to properly use a weapon of that type. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of armor, you are Encumbered whilst wearing armor of tht type. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of shield, you can't use a shield of that type to increase Defence. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of focus, you can't use a focus of that type to cast any Spell. <br>
### Training: Occupations, Educations, Vehicles, Games, and Instruments.
If you have any Training in some area, ham it up! If you can describe how your training should let you be better at making a Test, you gain Advantage on that Test for free! You need only ask the GM to make sure :) <br>
*Examples: Gain adventage on a Performance Test by playing an instrument you've practiced, on a Handling Test for controlling a machine you've worked with regularily, or on a Lore Test regarding a subject you are educated in.* <br>

# Spellcasting
To cast a Spell, you need to be holding a focus. If the Spell is contained within an item (like a scroll or magic weapon), that item doubles as the focus. <br>
If you know a Spell by yourself, you must use a special item that works as a focus for one of the Spell Lists the Spell in question belongs to. To use such a focus this way, you must be Proficient with its type. <br>
If a Spell forces a Save to be made, the Difficulty for that Save is equal to the caster's Passive Magic Skill.

## Spell Slots
If you know a Spell, you can cast it by expending a Spell Slot of a Rank no lower that the Spell's Rank. <br>
If you cast a Spell by expending a Spell Slot of a greater Rank than is needed, the casted Spell's Rank increases to match the Slot (which matters for Counterspell etc). A lot of Spells also have additional benefits if cast at greater Ranks, keep an eye out for those! <br>
You regain any expended Spell Slots after you finish an adventure (aka Long Rest?).

### Cantrips
If a Spell has the "Cantrip"-tag, it is really simple and non-taxing to cast compared to other spells of that Rank. <br>
If you know a Cantrip Spell, you can cast that Spell without using a focus or expending a Spell Slot.

# Timescales
To reduce the need for calculations of interpretations, we often measure time in abstract terms:<br>
+ X Action(s): About 1-3 seconds. The time it takes to do something in the heat of the moment. This is the only timescale we regularily use varying amounts of at a time.
+ A Round: About 10 seconds of real time. It's the time it takes for everyone in a scene to both act and process what just happened.
+ A Minute: Long enough to last for a Combat Scene, but not beyond that. If you have to count Rounds as a timer, 1 Minute = 6 rounds, including the one when the counting starts.
+ An Hour: Long enough to last through multiple Combat Scenes, one entire travelling scene, or one otherwise extended period of time.
+ A Day: 24 hours. The time you have until you have finished your next rest (or the point where you really *should* have rested if you didn't).
+ A Year: Hundreds of days. Enough to not end until well after an adventure is wrapped up, or even multiple adventures.
