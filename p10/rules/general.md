# General Rules 
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences the player's decisions. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.

## Tests
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value between 10 and 30. <br>
The value will often be predetermined and already written on someone's character sheet. If it isn't, the GM can pick a value on the spot <br>
10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
easy | medium | hard | very hard | nearly impossible
<br><br>
Then, the charcter being tested rolls a d20 and add/subtract any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. <br>
You can always choose to fail a Test if you wish to do so.

### Advantage & Disadvantage
The surrounding circumstances for a Test may be either helpful or hurtful. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that reasonably impede the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

### Checks, Attacks, & Saves
There are three specific type of Test: Checks, Attacks, & Saves. While there are some Tests that fall into none of these categories, the vast majority of situations will be covered by one of them.
<br><br>
**Checks** are used for a lot of different things. It it the general-purpose "I want to see if I can do this thing"-Test, and as such the Difficulty will often be chosen by the GM on the spot. <br>
When the GM tells you to make a Check, they will also name a Skill. Several relevent modifiers for a Check are determined by the named Skill as follows:
 + Your Modifier for the Attribute associated with the named Skill.
 + Your Level, if you have Proficiency with the named Skill.
 + A +5 bonus, if you have Expertise with the named Skill. <br>
 Also, if your character has undergone some sort of Training that may be relevant to a Check, make sure to mention it! If the GM agrees on the relevance, the Check is made with Advantage.
<br><br>
**Attacks** are made when you are attempting to damage a target, by hitting a creature or striking an object. The Difficulty is determined by the Defense of the target, and succeeding lets you deal the designated damage of the attack to said target, along with whatever other effects are noted for the attack. <br>
Several relevent modifiers for a Check are determined by how the attack is made:

 + Your Strength Modifier, if it is a Melee Weapon Attack.
 + Your Agility Modifier, if it is a Ranged Weapon Attack.
 + Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier, if it is a Spell Attack.
 + Your Level, if you are Proficient with the weapon type that's being used.

<br><br>
*Saves* are not made as an action on your turn, but rather as the automatic reflex to resist something being done to you. How Difficult it is to resist such an effect depends entirely on the source, but failing a Save ensures that you suffer the full force of the effect. <br>
When the GM tells you to make a Save, they will also name an Attribute. Several relevent modifiers for a Check are determined by the named Attribute as follows:

 + Your Modifier for the named Attribute.
 + Your Level, if you are Proficient with the given type of Save.
