# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Check is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Checl, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value no higher than 40, often predetermined and noted on some involved character's sheet. <br>
In cases where a value has not been determined, the GM can pick a value on the spot, typically 10, 15, or 20. <br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Trivial | Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Intense | Formidable | Legendary | Essentially Impossible

#### <br>
Then, the creature being tested rolls a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. <br>
Because Tests are made when success and failure are both equally acceptable outcomes, rolling a natural 1 is always a failure and a natural 20 is always a success. <br>
If you are forced to make a Check, you can always choose to fail if so wish.

## Attribute/Skill Bonuses
You will essentially never be asked to just "make a Check" without any additional information. <br>
Instead, the instructions will specify more information regarding the Check's Attribute or Skill. For example: "Strength Check", "Make a Martial Attack", "Make a Magic Intelligence Save", "Make an Acrobatics Test".
<br><br>
If you make a Check with a specified Attribute (for example a "Martial Strength Save"), you add the value you have for that Attribute to your roll. <br>
If you make a Check with a specified Skill (for example a "Brawn Test" or "Martial Agility Attack"), you add the values you have for that Skill AND the Attrubute the Skill is based on to your roll. <br>

### Types of Checks
Checks are often referred to with other names to designate a type, but all types of Checks are performed in the exact same way: Roll a d20, add some modifier, compare to difficulty. <br>
These names are meant to explain the context where certain Checks are often made. They also act as identifiers, which may make them elligable for special features/benefits that don't apply to ALL Checks, only ones of a specific type.
<br><br>
**Attacks**<br>
Attacks are Checks that you make when you are trying to land a hit on a creature or break an object.
The Difficulty of the Check is determined by target's Defence (or Hardness if it's an inanimate object?).
On a success, you've landed a decent hit against the target, dealing damage and/or triggering any effects that occur on a hit. <br>
Attacks are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill, but often don't specify which attribute (meaning that you get to pick).
<br><br>
**Saves**<br>
Saves are Checks that you are *forced* to make by some external influence actively attempting to affect you involontarily. <br>
The Difficulty of the Check is often pre-determined by one of the source's Passive Skills, but may also be improvised by the GM on occation. <br>
On a success, the incoming effect may be negated (or at least partially mitigated). On a fail, you suffer the full extend of the effect. <br>
Saves are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill, usually with a specified Attribute.
<br><br>
**Tests**<br>
Tests are Checks that you make to see if some defined task sits within your skillset, provided you spend the time needed to try using any required tools. <br>
On a success, you will successfully complete the defined task to whatever degree is reasonable in the given context. After succeeding, you will not be forced to retry the same Check just to maintain the result. <br>
On a fail, you suffer whatever the consequences of a failure would be in the given context. After failing, you may not retry the same Check without somehow altering the context in a significant way. <br>
Checks will always specify a Skill, usually one that is bound by an Attribute, but sometimes the Martial or Magic Skills are the most appropriate.

### Increasing Bonuses: Skill Points.
As a base, your Skill Bonus for every Skill is 0. You increase them by putting Skill Points into them (1 SP put in a Skill = +1 Skill Bonus for that Skill). You gain Skill Points to spend in a variety of ways, including from your Background and at each Class Level. <br>
If you have Skill Points to spend, you can spend them to put into any available Skill(s) of your choice, up until the Skill Bonus is 10. <br>
If you would put enough Skill Points into a specific Skill to exeed 10, you regain the excess to spend as you wish on something else. <br>
<br><br>
You can't spend Skill Points to increase any of the three Adventuring Skills (Martial, Magic, or Save) to be higher than your Level.<br>
You can't spend Skill Points to increase any Attribute-bound Skill to be higher than the Attribute it is bound by.<br>
*NOTE: This only applies to SPENDING Skill Points. If a certain feature makes you put Skill Points into a specific Skill, you may exceed these limits.*

## Advantage & Disadvantage
The surrounding circumstances for a Check may be either helpful or hurtful. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Check is made in circumstances that could reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Check is made in circumstances that could reasonably impede the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
There are no additional effects if a Check could use multiple sources of Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Check is made with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

## Proficiency & Training
Sometimes you can be more than just skilled, and sometimes merely being skilled is not enough to gain a benefit.
### Proficiency: Weapons, Shields, & Armor.
If you lack Proficiency with a type of weapon, you may not add your Martial Skill to any Attack you make using a weapon of that type. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of armor, your speed is halved and you can't cast Spells while you're wearing it. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of shield, you can't use a shield of that type to increase Defence. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of focus, you may not cast any Spell by using a focus of that type. <br>
### Training: Occupations, Educations, Vehicles, Games, and Instruments.
If you have any Training in some area, ham it up! If you can describe how your training would help you make a Test, you gain Advantage on that Test for free! You need only ask the GM to make sure :) <br>
*Examples: Gain adventage on a Performance Test by playing an instrument you've practiced, on a Handling Test for controlling a machine you've worked with regularily, or on a Lore Test regarding a subject you are educated in.*

# Spellcasting
To cast a Spell, you need to be holding a focus. If the Spell is contained within an item (like a scroll or magic weapon), that item doubles as the focus. <br>
If you know a Spell by yourself, you must use a special item that works as a focus for one of the Spell Lists the Spell in question belongs to. To use such a focus this way, you must be Proficient with it. <br>
If a Spell forces a Save to be made, the Difficulty for that Save is equal to the caster's Passive Magic Skill.

## Spell Slots
If you know a Spell, you can cast it by expending a Spell Slot of a Rank no lower that the Spell's Rank. <br>
If you cast a Spell by expending a Spell Slot of a greater Rank than is needed, the Spell's Rank increases to match (which matters for Counterspell etc). A lot of Spells also have additional benefits if cast at greater Ranks, keep an eye out for those! <br>
You regain any expended Spell Slots after you finish an adventure (aka Long Rest?).

### Cantrips
If a Spell has the "Cantrip"-tag, it is really simple and non-taxing to cast compared to other spells of that Rank. <br>
If you know a Cantrip Spell, you can cast that Spell without using a focus or expending a Spell Slot.

# Timescales
To reduce the need for calculations of interpretations, we often measure time in abstract terms:<br>
+ X Action(s): About 1-3 seconds. The time it takes to do something in the heat of the moment. This is the only timescale we regularily use varying amounts of at a time.
+ A Round: About 10 seconds of real time. It's the time it takes for everyone in a scene to both act and process what just happened.
+ A Minute: Long enough to last for a Combat Scene, but not beyond that. If you have to count Rounds as a timer, 1 Minute = 6 rounds, including the one when the counting starts.
+ An Hour: Long enough to last through multiple Combat Scenes, one entire travelling scene, or one otherwise extended period of time.
+ A Day: 24 hours. The time you have until you have finished your next rest (or point where you really *should* have rested if you didn't).
+ A Year: Hundreds of days. Enough to not end until well after an adventure is wrapped up, or even multiple adventures.
