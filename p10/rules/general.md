# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task, often by picking a predetermined value noted on some involved character's sheet. <br>
In cases where a value has not been determined, the GM can pick a value on the spot, typically 10 or 15.<br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Formidable | Legendary

#### <br>
Then, the creature being tested may dynimically assemble a collection of rolled dice, henceforth referred to as a Dice Pool.<br>
If the combined total of all values in the Dice Pool matches or exceeds the defined Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure.<br>
A creature can also decline to make Test when given the opportunity. Doing so is treated as automatically failing the Test.

## Assembling Dice Pools
A player should never be asked to "make a Test" without any relevant context or comprehensible instructions.<br>
The words used when a Test is asked for normally specify more details regarding which dice can be included in a Dice Pool using established quick-reference terminology. (For example: "Test of Acrobatics", "Magic Attack", or "Intelligence Save")<br>
Every Test must at least imply that a specific Attribute is being tested. The first die added to the Dice Pool is the one the tested creature has assigned to the implied attribute.<br>
Beyond that, there are several ways to add more.

### Actions
Each creature has a number of Actions it can use, each with an assigned die.<br>
Whenever a creature makes a Test, it may use any of its currently unused Actions to add their assigned dice to the rolled Dice Pool.<br>
During a, when

#### The Bonus Action Die
Depending on their equipment and abilities, an adventurer may be able to take "bonus actions" in addition to the actions they can use up. When this happens,<br>

### Skills
There are 16 Skills, 4 listed under each Attribute. Any Test of Skill also counts as a Test of the Attribute that Skill is listed under. For example: A "Test of Brawn" counts as a Test of Strength, which means that the Strength Die should be the first that was added to the Dice Pool.
<br><br>
Each Skill may have a die assigned to it. When a Test of Skill is made using a Skill with an assigned die, the tested creature may also add that die to its Dice Pool.

#### The Combat Skill Die
The life of an adventurer is a rough one and fighting is a learned "skill" all on its own. As such, any creature with a Level also has an assigned Combat Skill Die, the size of which is determined by its Level.<br>
A creature can add its Combat Skill Die to the Dice Pool for any Attack or Save it makes, as these are specific types of Tests heavily associated with the whole "risking your life"-business.
<br><br>
**Combat Skill Die Size at each Level:**
Unlevelled | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 | Beyond Levels
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
No die | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d20

#### Attacks
An Attack is a Test made to "score a hit" on a target, the Difficulty of which is equal to its Defence (or Hardness if it's an inanimate object).<br>
A "Martial Attack" is one made using either a weapon, improvised or otherwise, or the attacker's own body. When a creature makes a Martial Attack, it decides whether it counts as a Test of Strength or Agility, unless one is specifically demanded by the weapon being used.<br>
A "Magic Attack" is one made through casting a spell or using some unique supernatural ability. When a creature makes a Magic Attack, it decides whether it counts as a Test of Will or Intelligence, unless one is specifically demanded by the spell being used.

#### Saves
A Save is a Test a creature is *forced* to make by some external influence. When a creature makes a Save, it uses its Bonus Action Die, its Combat Skill Die, and the relevent Attribute Die.<br>
When the reason a Save is being forced is caused by a creature, either its Martial Might or its Magic Might will normally be used as the Difficulty.

## Degrees of Success
There are situations where the Degree of the result's effectiveness is measured. In these situations, the Degree starts at 0 and is increased by 1 for each increment of 5 the result exceeds the given Difficulty by.<br>
(For example: rolling a total of 12 on an attack against 10 Defence only counts as a "Baseline" or "1st Degree" hit. Rolling 16 instead would count as a "2nd Degree" hit, because 16 - 10 = 6 and 6/5 = 1 when the remainer is ignored. 3rd would be at 20, 4th at 25, and so on and so forth)<br>
These documents will henceforth use an asterisk to make values scaled by degrees of success more convenient. For example: "2*" means the same as "2 for a Baseline Success, and increased by 1 for each Degree above that".

## Advantage & Disadvantage
There are certain conditions or abilities that make an individual die be "rolled with Advantage" or "rolled with Disadvantage".<br>
If a die would be rolled with Advantage, roll it twice and use the higher of the two results as its final rolled value.<br>
If a die would be rolled with Disadvantage, roll it twice and use the lower of the two results as its final rolled value.<br>
If a die would be rolled with both Advantage and Disadvatange as the same time, roll it once as normal. Neither will stack with itself, and both cancel each other out.

## Rerolls
There are certain abilities that give creatures (mainly players) the chance to "reroll its Dice Pool" under certain conditions.<br>
When rerolling a Dice Pool, select any of the dice in them and roll them again, following whatever rules apply when rolling each of those particular dice.<br>
The new result override the previous ones.

### Training: Occupations, Educations, Vehicles, Games, & Instruments
Training is one of few ways to gain Advantage reliably.<br>
If you have any Training in some area, ham it up! If you can describe how your training should let you be better at a Test of Skill, you may roll Advantage on that Test for free! You need only ask the GM to make sure :) <br>
*Only non-Attack non-Save Tests are allegible.*
*Examples: Gain Advantage on a Test of Performance by playing an instrument you've practiced, on a Test of Handling for controlling a machine you've worked with regularily, or on a Test of Lore regarding a subject you are educated in.* <br>

# Timescales
To reduce the need for calculations of interpretations, we often measure time in abstract terms:<br>
+ **An Action:** About 1-3 seconds of real time. The time it takes to do something in the heat of the moment. During an Action Scene, the time partaking creatures takes to use their actions is overlapped.
+ **A Round:** About 10 seconds of real time. It's the time it takes for everyone in an Action Scene to both act on their own and process everything everyone else did.
+ **A Minute:** Long enough to last all the way through an Action Scene, but not much beyond that. If you have reasonly to strictly count the time passed in an Action Scene, 1 Minute = 6 rounds, including the one when the counting starts.
+ **An Hour:** Long enough to last through multiple Action Scenes, one entire Travelling Scene, a Rest, or an otherwise extended period of time.
+ **A Day:** 24 hours. The time you have until you have finished your next Rest (or a point where you really *should* have rested if you didn't).
+ **A Year:** Hundreds of days. Enough to not end until well after an adventure is wrapped up, or maybe even multiple adventures.

# Other Math/"Don't know where else to put this"
Whenever an odd number is halved the result is rounded up, EXCEPT when the number is 1. Treat half of 1 as though it was 0.
