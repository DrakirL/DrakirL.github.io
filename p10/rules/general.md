# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value, typically 10, 15, or 20. <br>
The value will often be predetermined and already written on someone's character sheet. If it isn't, the GM can pick a value on the spot <br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Trivial | Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Formidable | Essentially Impossible
<br><br>
Then, the charcter being tested rolls a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. <br>
Since Tests are made when both succeess and failure are acceptable outcomes, rolling a natural 1 is always a failure and a natural 20 is always a success. <br>
If you are forced to make a Test, you can always choose to fail it if so wish.

## Attribute/Skill Bonuses
You will essentially never be asked to just "make a Test" without any additional information. <br>
Instead, the instructions will specify more information regarding the Test's Attribute, Skill, and/or Type. For example: "Make a Charisma Test", "Make a Martial Attack", "Make an Acrobatics Check?", "Make an Intelligence Save".
<br><br>
If you make a Test with a specified Attribute, you add the value you have for that Attribute to your roll. <br>
If you make a Test with a specified Skill, you add the value you have for that Skill to your roll. <br>

### Types of Tests
Tests are often referred to with other names to designate the Type. They are performed in the exact same way (Fail if roll is lower than Difficulty, succeed is roll equal or higher), but these names explains the context where certain Tests are often made. They also act as identifiers, which may make them allegable for special features/benefits that don't apply to All

**Attacks**<br>
Attacks are Tests that you make when you are trying to harm a creature or damage an object.
The Difficulty of the Test is determined by target's Defence (or Hardness if it's an inanimate object).
On a success, you've landed a decent hit against the target, dealing it damage. The amount of damage dealt is determined by the weapon/spell used to attack. If you're just using your fists, it's 1, but you may choose to Grapple or Shove the target instead. <br>
Attacks are exclusively made using either the Martial or Magic Skill.

**Checks**<br>
Checks are Tests that you make to see if some task sits within your skillset. (PHRASING?) <br>
On a success, you will successfully complete the task, however long it happens to take, provided you're using the right tools/materials. On a fail, the time or resources used may be wasted, you suffer any consequences for failure, and you may be unable to try that specific Check again for a while (the circumstances must be changed in some way). <br>
Checks will specify a Skill much more often than an Attribute.

**Saves**<br>
Saves are Tests that you are *forced* to make by some external influence actively attempting to hit/inflict you with some kind of effect. <br>
The Difficulty of the Test should be pre-determined by the source's Attributes and Level?. <br>
On a success, the incoming effect may be negated (or at least partially mitigated). On a fail, you suffer the full extend of the effect. <br>
Saves most often specify an Attribute, but Skills are not that rare.

## Advantage & Disadvantage
The surrounding circumstances for a Test may be either helpful or hurtful. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that reasonably impede the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

## Training & Proficiency
???
### Proficiency: Weapons, Shields, & Armor.
If you lack Proficiency with a type weapon, you may not add your Martial Skill to any Attack you make using a weapon of that type. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of armor, your speed is halved and you can't cast spells while you're wearing it. <br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of shield, it does not help increase your Defence.
### Training: Tools?, Vehicles, Games, Instruments, & Education
If you are Trained in a subject, ham it up! If you can describe how your training would help you make a Check, you gain Advantage on that Check. <br>
*Example: Gain adventage on a Performance Check by playing an instrument you have practiced with, on a Handling Check for a vehicle you can drive well, or on a Lore Check regarding a subject you are educated in.*

# Spellcasting
There is one more Skill that is not treated like the rest: Spellcasting. It is only accessable to characters that know at least 1 Spell. <br>
If a character knows no Spells or has no defined Spellcasting Ability, treat their Spellcasting Skill bonus as a 0 should the need arise. <br>
