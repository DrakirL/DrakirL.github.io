# General Rules: TESTS
The game is determined by the GM narrating consequences of the actions the player's decide their character should take. <br>
If it is uncertain whether an attempted action should result in success or failure, a Test is made to determine the result.
<br><br>
To make a Test, first determine the Difficulty of the task being attempted as a value no higher than 35, often predetermined and noted on some involved character's sheet. <br>
In cases where a value has not been determined, the GM can pick a value on the spot, typically 10, 15, or 20. <br>
5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Trivial | Easy | Moderate | Challenging | Formidable | Legendary | Near Impossible

#### <br>
Then, the creature being tested rolls a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If the total for the roll matches or exceeds the Difficulty, the attempt is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. You can also decline to make Test without if so wish. Doing so counts as an automatic failure
<br><br>
Because Tests are made when either a success or failure would be an acceptable outcome, rolling a natural 1 always counts as a failure and a natural 20 is always at least a Baseline Success. <br>

## Greater Successes
There are situations where the Degree of the result's effectiveness is measured. In these situations, the Degree starts at 0 and is increased by 1 for each increment of 5 the result exceeds the given Difficulty by.<br>
(For example: rolling a 12 on an attack against 10 Defence only counts as a "Baseline Attack". Rolling 22 instead would count as an "Degree 1 Attack", because 22 - 10 = 12 and 12/10 = 1 when the remainer is ignored. Degree 2 would be at 30 and degree 3 would be at 40)<br>
These documents will henceforth use an asterisk to make values scaled by degrees of success more convenient. For example: "2*" means the same as "2 for a Baseline Success, and increased by 1 for each Degree above that".

## Relevant Modifiers
You will essentially never be asked to just "make a Test" without any additional information. <br>
Instead, the instruction will specify more information regarding the Check's Attribute or Skill. For example: "a Test of Acrobatics", "a Magic Attack", or "an Intelligence Save".
<br><br>
If you make a Test where a specific Attribute is implied, you add the value you have for that Attribute to your roll.<br>
If you make a Test that uses a Skill, you add a bonus equal to two times your Grade for that Skill.<br>
If you make a Test that uses your Combat Mastery, you add a bonus equal to 1 + your Level.

### Attacks & Saves
Tests can be referred to with other names to designate a specific type, but all types of Tests are performed in the exact same way: Roll a d20, add modifiers, compare to difficulty. <br>
These names do not affect the Test's function, but is only meant to explain the context where certain Checks are often made. There are however a lot of effects that exclude or specify which Tests they can be applied to, and using these names is useful for that.
<br><br>
**Attacks**<br>
An Attack is a Test made to "score a hit" on a target. They are declared as either Martial or Magic attacks, letting you choose one of two Attributes to add. Regardless of which attribute is used, you also add your Combat Mastery to your roll.<br>
The Difficulty of the Test is generally determined by target's Defence (or "Hardness" if it's an inanimate object).<br>
On a success, you land a decent hit on the target, dealing damage and/or triggering any effects that occur on a hit. At greater degrees of success, increase the damage/effects. (DETAILS? PHRASING?)
<br><br>
**Saves**<br>
A Save is a Test that you are *forced* to make by some external influence. As such, you don't decide when to attempt them and you don't need to use any Actions to do so. Regardless of which Attribute is used, you add your Combat Mastery to your roll.<br>
The Difficulty of the Test is often pre-determined by the source's Martial Might or Magic Might, but may also be improvised by the GM on occation.<br>
On a success, the incoming effect may be negated (or at least partially mitigated). On a fail, you suffer the full extend of the effect. <br>
There is no Skill associated with Saves. Instead, you add your Level to any Save you make.

### Skills
There are 16 Skills, 4 assigned under each Attribute. When you make a Test of Skill (for example a "Test of Brawn", "Test of Lore", or "Test of Intuition"), you treat the Attribute the given Skill is assigned under as the specified Attribute and add it to the result as normal.
<br><br>
You have a defined Grade for each of your Skills, ranging from 0 to 3. When you make a Test using a given Skill, you add a modifier equal to two times your Grade for that Skill. <br>
You have a total number of "Skill Points" from your background, Intelligence, Class Levels. If the combined Grades you have for all Skills is lower than your total Skill Points, increase some Grades! (PHRASING?)

## Advantage & Disadvantage
When a Test is made, the surrounding context and circumstances may be either helpful or hurtful to it. This is represented by giving the roll either Advantage or Disadvantage. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that could reasonably increase the chance of success, it is made with Advantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *higher* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
If a Test is made in circumstances that could reasonably reduce the chance of success, it is made with Disadvantage: Roll the d20 twice and use the *lower* of the two rolls as the natural result. <br>
There are no additional effects if a Test could use multiple sources of Advantage or Disadvantage. Only one of each counts. <br>
If a Test is made with both Advantage and Disadvantage, roll the d20 once, as though it had neither.

## Proficiency & Training
Sometimes you can be more than just skilled, and sometimes merely being skilled is not enough to gain a benefit or avoid a penalty.
### Proficiency: Weapons, Shields, Armor, & Foci
If you lack Proficiency with a type of weapon, you gain Disadvantage on any Attack made properly using a weapon of that type.<br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of armor, you are Encumbered whilst wearing armor of that type.<br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of shield, you can't use a shield of that type to Block.<br>
If you lack Proficiency with a type of focus, you can't use a focus of that type to cast Spells of that type.<br>
### Training: Occupations, Educations, Vehicles, Games, & Instruments
If you have any Training in some area, ham it up! If you can describe how your training should let you be better at making a Test, you gain Advantage on that Test for free! You need only ask the GM to make sure :) <br>
*Only non-Attack non-Save Tests are allegible.*
*Examples: Gain Advantage on a Performance Test by playing an instrument you've practiced, on a Handling Test for controlling a machine you've worked with regularily, or on a Lore Test regarding a subject you are educated in.* <br>

# Timescales
To reduce the need for calculations of interpretations, we often measure time in abstract terms:<br>
+ **X Action(s):** About 1-3 seconds of real time. The time it takes to do something in the heat of the moment. This is the only timescale we regularily use specific amounts of at a time.
+ **A Round:** About 10 seconds of real time. It's the time it takes for everyone in an Action Scene to both act on their own and process everything everyone else did.
+ **A Minute:** Long enough to last all the way through an Action Scene, but not beyond that. If you have to count Rounds as a timer, 1 Minute = 6 rounds, including the one when the counting starts.
+ **An Hour:** Long enough to last through multiple Action Scenes, one entire Travelling Scene, a Rest, or an otherwise extended period of time.
+ **A Day:** 24 hours. The time you have until you have finished your next Rest (or a point where you really *should* have rested if you didn't).
+ **A Year:** Hundreds of days. Enough to not end until well after an adventure is wrapped up, or even multiple adventures.

# Other Math/"Don't know where else to put this"
When we halve a number, we round up. EXCEPT when the halved number is 1. Treat half of one as 0.
