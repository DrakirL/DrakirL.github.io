## Rounds and Turns
???

## HP & Damage
A creature's hardiness is determined by its Hit Die (Which is determined by Size for most monsters, but by Class for players) and expressed in the form of Hit Points, or HP for short. <br>
As long as a creature has at least 1 remaining HP, it is not dead or dying and able to act normally. A player's Maximum HP is equal to the size of their Hit Die times their Level.

### Lethal Damage & Death's Door
If a creature takes damage that reduces its HP to 0, that damage is considered Lethal. When a creature takes Lethal damage, the attacker decides whether to kill that creature or just "take it out", potentially leaving the target unconcious for an undetermined amount of time. <br>
Some creatures should not be that easy to defeat however, the main example being PLAYER CHARACTERS. When a such a creature takes Lethal damage, whether the attacker intends to "take them out" or outright kill them, it instead gains 1 point of exhaustion and enter the state of "Death's Door".
<br> <br>
A creature on Death's Door is Incapacitated and must make a Death Roll at the start of each of its turns. To make a Death Roll, Roll your Hit Die. If the result is higher than your Exhaustion, you regain HP equal to your roll - your Exhaustion and are thus no longer on Death's Door. Otherwise, your Exhaustion increases by 1 and you remain on Death's Door. <br>
A creature is not defeated (whether killed or "taken out") until it gains its sixth Exhaustion.

## Actions
During combat, every second counts, and it is important to know how every moment of every round is spent. <br>
To do this, we use Actions. An adventurer gets 3 Actions at the start of the combat, and regains them *AFTER* finishing their turn. <br>
You may spend these Actions on your turn for whatever task you decide to spend your time on attempting. The details regarding the most common reoccuring options have been pre-defined.
<br><br>
If someone wants to do something not covered by any of the defined actions below, it may still be done, either as part of another action or as an Action on its own. <br>
Here are some guidelines if you need to improvise:
+ Doing a thing one time = Using one action. It doesn't matter how much the thing could affect.
+ If it's on your turn and a Test is required, it should probably use an Action.
+ 1 Action = about a second or two of active effort. If it takes longer than that, it should use more than 1 Action and probably be Distracting.
+ Reactions arenâ€™t improvised. Use "Prepared Actions" instead.

#### <br>
Examples:
+ As part of any Action where you move to a different space, you may open a door as you pass through it, or close it if it was already opened (but not both?). If the door is locked, or you want to lock it behind you, you can't just "move through" without dealing with the situation, which takes 1 Action.
+ As part of any Action that relies on you using an object, you may use a free hand to grab hold of that object if it is easily attainable, such as on your belt or on the ground next to you. You may not both stuff away an object and grab a new one with the freed hand using same action, as that is covered by the Fetch/Search/Equip? Action.
+ As part of any Action, you may ask the GM questions about what your character knows, sees, hears, etc. If you need to make a Test to find something out, it's its own Action.
#### <br>
### Pre-Defined Actions

**Attack Action** <br>
Make an Unarmed Strike or one Weapon Attack with a weapon you are holding (or as you draw it, since that is allowed as normal). <br>
If you are holding a weapon in each hand and they both have the Light property, you can make one attack with each (but you don't add your Martial Skill to the off-hand attack as normal). <br>
If the Attack is a Ranged Weapon Attack, it is Distracting?
<br><br>

**Brace Action** <br>
Until the start of your next turn, add a +1 bonus to your Defence and any Save you make. <br> 
*Note: This CAN stack with itself. Brace-tanking is a valid strategy!*
<br><br>

**Care Action** <br>
Make a Medicine Check to try and stabilize a creature on Death's Door (Difficulty = 10 + Exhaustion). <br>
On a success, the creature is stabilized/regains 1 HP/succeeds on a Death Roll? (DETAILS?)
Taking this Action is Distracting?
<br><br>

**Dash** <br>
Pick one of your speeds. Move to an unoccupied space within the distance of your chosen speed. <br>
Your movement is dynamically affected by difficult terrain etc. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
You can also make jumps as part of this action, even ones that require checks. <br>
Taking this Action is Distracting. Moving within other creature's reach is also distracting?
<br><br>

**Fetch/Search/Equip? Action** <br>
Stow away and/or grab hold of any number of items you want. <br>
You may reach into one bag or similar container to stow items into/access items from. <br>
Taking this Action is Distracting.
<br><br>

**Hide Action** <br>
Make a Stealth Check and note your total. That value is how well you are hiding. <br>
Any creature with an Awareness lower than the noted number does not know where you are, provided you are fully covered from it. <br>
Your Hiding can end in a *LOT* of different ways. (DETAILS?)
<br><br>

**Spell Action** <br>
Begin casting a Spell you know. Casting a Spell requires you putting your whole body into it. It is loud, clear, and obvious when a Spell is cast (and often also what spell it is). <br>
If the Spell requires more than 1 Action to cast, doing so is Distracting. If the casting time is even longer (Minute = 10 rounds, Hour = 600 rounds), it requires all of your actions *every round* that entire time.
<br><br>

**Step Action** <br>
Move to a neighbouring unoccupied (5-foot) space. <br>
Is unaffected by difficult terrain etc. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)

### Pre-Defined Reactions

**Strike Reaction**
When a creature within your reach takes a Distracting Action, you may make a Sudden Strike against it.<br>
A Sudden Strike is a single Unarmed Strike or Melee Weapon Attack using an already equipped weapon. If the attack hits, the triggering Action(s) is interrupted and does not occur. <br>
*Note: This doesn't waste resources. Only the Actions themselves. Spell Slots, components, and equipment are all safe.*

### Reserving/Delaying Actions
To reserve Actions, you first spend the amount of actions needed on your turn and specify a trigger.
Then, if the trigger occurs before your next turn, you spend that many actions again to do the thing.

## Conditions & Common Situations
???

### Cover
Terrain is seldom just an empty floor. So you could be "behind something" or "obscured by something" as viewed from a creature's perspective. <br>
What counts as cover depends on a lot of circumstances regarding both a target and an observer. For example: A Small creature may be Fully Covered by an object that a Medium creature is only Partially Covered by. A creature may be obscured by darkness, fog, or an *Invisibility* Spell and thus fully obscured to a commoner, but just plainly out in the open to a dragon with no need to just *see* its target.
<br> <br>
**Partially Covered**
A partially covered creature may be targeted with Disadvantage, unless you already have Disadvantage for other reasons. <br>
<br><br>
**Fully Covered**
Flatout "Not an allegable target".<br>
Creatures can still tell where you are (due to other senses or a basic sense of object permanence) unless you actively attempt to *hide*.

### Defined Conditions
<br><br>
**Blinded** <br>
A Blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on sight. <br>
*Note: Since you can't see, it's like everything is behind a "Full Cover" for you.*
<br><br>
**Charmed** <br>
A Charmed creature is unable to make Attacks against the source of the condition. <br>
Said source also gains Advantage on any Check it makes to socially interact with the creature.
<br><br>
**Deafened** <br>
A Deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on hearing.
<br><br>
**Frightened** <br>
A Frightened creature is unable to make a move that ends in a space closer to the source of the condition than where it started. <br>
The creature also gains Disadvantage on any Check it makes to socially interact with the source of its fear.
<br><br>
**Incapacitated** <br>
An Incapacitated Creature can't take Actions.
<br><br>
**Sick** <br>
A Sick creature gains Disadvantage on any Test (maybe not Saves?) it makes.
<br><br>
**Stunned** <br>
A 
<br><br>
**Unconcious** <br>
??

### Other
**Concentration**
You can only be Concentrating on one thing at a time. <br>
When a Concentrating Creature takes damage, it must make a Magic Save (Difficulty = damage taken). On a failed Save, its Concentration is broken.
**Downed/Knocked Down**
Smaller "Hitbox". Some Partial Cover can become Full Cover. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)<br>
Whilst downed, your Speed is halved. <br>
A downed creature can use 1 Action to stand up. Taking this Action is Distracting. <br>
A flying creature that is knocked down falls until it hits the ground and takes fall damage from it.
**Grappling**
If you have a creature grappled, it can't move to a new space, and any attack it makes against a target other than you gains Disadvantage. <br>
The grappled creature can use 1 Action to make a Martial Check against your Passive Martial Skill, freeing itself on a success.

Weapons are tools meant for combat. If you hit a target with an Unarmed Attack, you can deal it 1 damage. <br>

## Armor
In inventory: Goes under "Worn" to be used. <br>
Needless to say, you can't wear multiple suits of armor at once.

+ Leather: 11 + AGI Defence.
+ Hide: 12 + AGI Defence.
+ Chain Shirt: 13 + AGI Defence.

You can only gain the benefit from one shield at a time, so there's no point to carrying multiple.

### Small
+1 Defence if Worn (like a wrist guard?), +2 if held.

### Large
+2 Defence if Worn (like a wrist guard?), +3 if Held.
