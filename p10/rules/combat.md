# Combat Rules 
???

## Rounds and Turns
???

## HP & Damage
A creature's hardiness is  expressed in the form of Hit Points, or HP for short. A player's Maximum HP is equal to their Strength Attribute plus the size of their Hit Die (determined by their class) times their Level. <br>
As long as a creature has at least 1 HP, it is healthy enough to stand up and act as normal. <br>
As long as a creature has HP at least equal to its Death Threshold, it is able to fully recover if given enough rest. *(FYI: At this point we're using negative numbers)* <br>
A creature with fewer HP than its Death Threshold is *DEAD*.

### Lethal Damage & Death's Door
If a creature takes damage that reduces its HP to 0 or below, that damage is considered Lethal. When a creature takes Lethal damage, its controller decides whether to relinquish their control (by dying or falling unconcious for an indeterminate amount of time, depending on context and the attacker's intent) or remain active on Death's Door. <br>
A creature is considered to be on Death's Door as long as it has 0 or fewer HP without being dead or otherwise taken out. <br>
A creature on Death's Door can't maintain Concentration, ???, and has only 1 Action to take per Round. <br>

### Lasting Damage: Exhaustion
When a creature takes damage that reduces its HP below 0, its Exhaustion is set to reflect it. (PHRASING? -5 HP = 5 Exhaustion. 2 more damage = 7 Exhastion. Healed = still 7 Exhaustion)<br>
A creature can have an amount of Exhaustion up to their Death Threshold and remain active. *Penalty from having exhaustion? <br>
If it ever has any more, its controller must relinquish their control (death/unconciousness).

## Actions
During combat, every second counts, and it is important to know how every moment of every round is spent. <br>
To do this, we use Actions. An adventurer gets 3 Actions at the start of a battle, and regains them *AFTER* finishing their turn. <br>
The details regarding the most common reoccuring options have been pre-defined, but if someone wants to do something not defined, it may still be done, either as part of another action or as an Action on its own. <br>
You may spend these Actions on your turn for whatever task you decide to spend your time to attempt.
<br><br>
Here are some guidelines if you need to improvise:
+ Doing one thing one time = Using one action. It doesn't matter how much the thing could end up affecting down the road.
+ If a non-Save Test is made, it should use an Action.
+ 1 Action = about a second or two of active effort. If it takes longer than that, it should use more than 1 Action and probably be Interruptible.
+ Reactions arenâ€™t improvised. Use "Prepared Actions" instead. <br>
#### <br>

Examples:
+ As part of any Action where you move to a different space, you may open a door as you pass through it, or close it if it was already opened (but not both?). If the door is locked, or you want to lock it behind you, you can't just "move through" without dealing with the situation, so it takes 1 Action to do.
+ As part of any Action that relies on you using an object, you may use a free hand to grab hold of that object if it is easily attainable, such as on your belt or on the ground next to you. You may not both stuff away an object and grab a new one with the freed hand using same action, as that is covered by the Fetch/Search/Equip? Action.
+ As part of any Action, you may ask the GM questions about what your character knows, sees, hears, etc. If you need to make a Test to find something out, it's takes its own Action.
#### <br>

### Pre-Defined Actions

**Attack Action** <br>
Make a Martial Attack, using either your body or an object you are holding in either hand (or drawing/picking up as part of the same action), against a target within your reach or range. <br>
When you score a hit with a Martial Attack, you may do one of the following things:
+ Deal 1 damage to the target (Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing depending on context)
+ Grapple the target.
+ Shove the target 1 Pace.
+ Knock Down the target (provided it is no larger than you).
+ Knock an object out of the target's grip. (PHRASING?)
#### <br>

*If the Attack is Ranged, it is Interruptible. (PHRASING?)* <br>
*Extended Range: You can attack any target within the defined range as normal. You can attack a target outside that range by applying a -1 penalty on the Test for each Pace you exceed the range by.*
*Crits: On a Natural 20, double the result of the Success Grade.* <br>
*Shove: You can stack distance for a single shove, but it must all be in a single direction.*
<br><br>

**Brace Action** <br>
Prepare for the worst and steel your nerves by using any number of Actions. <br>
Until the start of your next turn, you add a +1 bonus to your Defence, Awareness, and any Save you make. <br>
*Yes, this can be stacked with itself.*
<br><br>

**Care Action** <br>
Make a Medicine Test to try and mitigate the damage a severly hurt creature has taken (Difficulty = 10 + target's Exhaustion). <br>
On a success, the creature is regains 1 HP (+1 per Stage), but not over 0. (PHRASING?) <br>
This Action is Interruptible.
<br><br>

**Fetch/Search/Equip/Inventory/Sort? Action** <br>
Stow away and/or grab hold of any number of items you want. <br>
You may reach into one bag or similar container to stow items into/access items from.
This Action is Interruptible.
<br><br>

**Help Action** <br>
Declare which creature you are helping and what kind of Test you will be aiding them with to gain a d6 Help Die until your next turn. *For roleplay reasons, you have to descibe how you are able to help to do so. Have good reasons, and your declaration could be allowed some room for vagueness or generous interpretation* <br>
You cannot declare the same creature and Test more than once in a given turn. (PHRASING? At least one must differ. You can help multiple creatures with one Martial Attack each or help one creature with multiple different Tests.)
<br><br>
When that creature makes a Test of the declared kind whilst within your Reach, roll your prepared Help Die and add it to their total roll. <br>
Alternatively, if the type of Test you declare is an Attack, when that creature Attacks a target that is within your Reach, you can roll your prepared Help Die and add it to their total roll.
<br><br>

**Hide Action** <br>
Choose a creature or a group of creatures from which you are fully covered and make a Stealth Test against the highest Awareness amongst them. On a success, none of the creatures you chose will know where you went. <br>
Your Hiding can end in a *LOT* of different ways, such as you making a noise louder than a whisper or the cover somehow being left/removed/circumvented. (PHRASING?)
*If they want to find you with a check, such as Investigation or Intuition, what should the Difficulty be? Passive Martial Skill?* <br>
*Your Stealth Test is made with Advantage if your target(s) have not yet been made aware of your presence.*
<br><br>

**Move Action** <br>
Pick one of your speeds. Move to an unoccupied space within the distance of your chosen speed. <br>
You may choose to double the speed as you use it, but doing so limits you to move in a straight line and makes the Action Interruptible.<br>
Your movement you spend is dynamically affected by difficult terrain etc. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
You can also make one Check as part of this action to make a tough jump or push through a blockade. <br>
*Making tough jumps: Make an Athletics Test. The total roll result determines the maximum distances the jump can cover (1 horizontal pace for every increment of 5 and 1 vertical pace for every increment of 10). If you make the jump from doubled movement, you gain Advantage. If you make the jump from standing, you gain Disadvantage.* <br>
*Pushing through blockades: Make a Brawn Test against the blockade's Hardness (if it's an inanimate object) or Martial Might (if it's a creature). If it's at least one Size smaller than you, you gain Advantage. If it's at least one Size larger than you, you gain Disadvantage.*
<br><br>

**Spell Action** <br>
Begin to cast a Spell you have access to through some means. Casting a Spell requires you putting your whole body into it. It is loud, clear, and obvious when a Spell is cast (and most of the time also what spell it is). <br>
If the casting time is not measured in Actions, the Spell cannot be used in combat. <br>
This Action is Interruptible, regardless of what Spell is cast. <br>
<br><br>

### Pre-Defined Reactions

**Sudden Strike Reaction**
When a creature within your Reach takes an Interruptible Action, you can use 1 Action to make a Sudden Strike against it. <br>
A Sudden Strike is a single Melee Martial Attack (Improvised or Proper, using whatever the attacker already has equipped). <br>
If the attack hits, the triggering Action(s) are interrupted at the point when the Strike was declared, preventing any events they would cause from that point forwards. The desired on-hit effects of the Attack, such as damage, are applied as normal. <br>
*Note: This doesn't waste any resources, only the Actions themselves. MP, components, ammunition, etc. are all safe.* <br>
*Note: Grappling and Shoving count as attacks, so you can grab or shove someone to prevent them from running.*

**Spell Contribution Reaction**
When another creature within your Reach casts a Spell, you can use 1 Action to spend any amount of MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) and add it to the mana value of that Spell.<br>
To do so, you must describe what you do to improve their odds. *Just so there is some thematic thinking behind it...*

### Reserving/Delaying Actions
To reserve Actions, you first spend the amount of actions needed on your turn and specify a trigger.
Then, if the trigger occurs before your next turn, you spend that many actions again to do the thing.

## Conditions & Common Situations
???

### Cover
Terrain is seldom just an empty floor. So you could be "behind something" or "obscured by something" when viewed from a creature's perspective. <br>
What counts as cover depends on a lot of circumstances regarding both a target and an observer. For example: A Small creature may be Fully Covered by an object that a Medium creature is only Partially Covered by. <br>
A creature may be obscured by darkness, fog, or an *Invisibility* Spell and thus completely obscured to a commoner, but just plainly out in the open to a dragon that has no need to just *see* its target.
<br> <br>
**Partially Covered**
A partially covered creature may be still be targeted, but with Disadvantage. If Disadvantage is already imposed for some other reason, it is NOT an allegable target anymore. <br>
<br><br>
**Fully Covered**
Flatout "Not an allegable target". <br>
Creatures can still tell where you are (due to other senses or a basic understanding of object permanence) unless you actively attempt to *Hide*.

### Defined Conditions
<br><br>
**Blinded** <br>
A Blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on sight. <br>
*Note: Since you can't see, it's like everything is behind a "Full Cover" for you.*
<br><br>
**Charmed** <br>
A Charmed creature is unable to make Attacks against the source of the condition. <br>
Said source also gains Advantage on any Test it makes to socially interact with the creature.
<br><br>
**Deafened** <br>
A Deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on hearing.
<br><br>
**Frightened** <br>
A Frightened creature is unable to make a move that ends in a space closer to the source of the condition than where it started. <br>
The creature also gains Disadvantage on any Test it makes to socially interact with the source of its fear.
<br><br>
**Incapacitated** <br>
An Incapacitated Creature can't take Actions.
<br><br>
**Sick/Sickened/Poisoned?** <br>
A Sick creature gains Disadvantage on any Test (maybe not Saves?) it makes.
<br><br>
**Stunned** <br>
A Stunned creature is Incapacitated. Extra penalties?
<br><br>
**Unconcious** <br>
An Unconcious creature is Incapacitated. Extra penalties?

### Other
**Concentration** <br>
When a creature begins concentrating, its Stress is set to its Starting Stress. <br>
When a Concentrating creature takes damage, it must add the damage taken to its Stress and make a Will Save against the new value. <br>
A creature can maintain Concentration on no more than one thing at a time. <br>
<br><br>

**Falling** <br>
If a creature that isn't suspended by standing on solid ground or the ability to fly, it falls. <br>
A falling creature will reach the first stable point directly below it by the time it regains its Actions. <br>
Upon landing, the creature takes 1 damage for each pace it fell, ignoring ones that are "covered by a jump". ()<br>
<br>
If a falling creature lands on a more cushoning surface, the damage is halved. <br>
Landing on other creatures counts as landing on a cushioning surface. Each creature involved takes resulting damage.
<br><br>

**Downed/Knocked Down** <br>
A creature can "Down itself" as part of any other action. Smaller "Hitbox". Some Partial Cover can become Full Cover. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
Whilst a creature is downed, its Speeds are halved. <br>
A downed creature can use 1 Action to stand up. Taking this Action is Interruptible. <br>
A flying creature that is forcefully knocked down will fall until it hits the ground. It takes fall damage as normal.
<br><br>

**Pushing/Throwing** <br>
When a creature is moved by force, it instantly travels the appropriate number of paces in a straight line determined by said force. (PHRASING? horizontal only)<br>
If the intended path of travel is blocked by an obstacle, the creature stops in the last empty space it occupied before the collision and takes 1 damage for each pace of the intended path it didn't travel.<br>
Being forcefully pushed into another creature counts as being blocked by an obstacle, but the damage is halved and dealt to both creatures.
<br><br>

**Grappling** <br>
If a creature is grappled by something, it can't move into a new space, and any attack it makes against a target other than its grappler gains Disadvantage. <br>
Whatever is being used to maintain the grapple (such as a tool or a limb) can't be used for anything else without releasing the grappled creature. <br>
A creature can use 1 Action on its turn to attempt breaking itself or another creature within its Reach free from a grapple. To do so, it must succeed on a Martial Test against the grappler's Martial Might. <br>
A creature can use 1 Action on its turn to attempt throwing a creature it is grappling up to its base throwing range. To do so, it must succeed on a Martial Test against the grappled creature's Martial Might (Advantage if thrower is bigger, Disadvantage if thrower is smaller). Each degree of success increases the maximum distance by 1 pace. Successful or not, the creature is released from the grapple.
<br><br>

# Combat Equipment
???

## Weapons
Weapons are tools meant for combat and therefore improve any Martial Attack you make were you are using it properly. The exact requirements for what counts as "wielding a weapon properly" are determined by the weapon's properties, but as long as you follow every restriction is followed, you gain all its benefits. <br>

## Shields
If you are wielding a shield when an Attack is made against you or a target entirely within your reach, you can use 1 Action to add the Shield's Defence Bonus to the target's Defence against that attack, potentially changing the outcome. <br>
Each type of shield is categorized as either Small or Large. If you don't have Proficiency with the category of a shield you are wielding, you can't use it to increase Defence in this way. <br>

## Armor
Each type of armor has a defined Protection Value that you add to the Defence of anyone who is weaing it. <br>
Characters have an inventory slot for the armor they are wearing. Needless to say, you can't wear multiple suits of armor at once. <br>
Any given set of armor is categorized as either Light or Heavy. If you don't have Proficiency with the category of the armor you are wearing, it Encumbers you.

There are a few specific types of equipment or spells that can grant a creature a sense, but usually it will be derived from biology. <br>
*NOTE: The functions listed below are all VERY MUCH NOT set in stone.* <br>

+ Darkvision? Nightsight?: 2 Perception. You can see in complete darkness as if it were only dim light, and in dim light as if it were fully lit. *NOTE: This mitigates light-based obscurement*
+ Blindsight? "vibes"?: 3 Perception. You can tell what is going on at all times without needing to use your senses normally? *NOTE: This negates light-based obscurement entirely*
+ Truesight?: 4 Perception. You can tell the exact nature of all things at a glance? (PHRASING?) *NOTE: This counters illusions and transformations*
#### <br>
