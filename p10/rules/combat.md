## Staying Alive
A creature's hardiness is expressed in the form of Hit Points, or HP for short. A player's Maximum HP is equal to their Strength Attribute plus their "Hit Points per Level" (determined by their class) times their Level. (PHRASING? Do we need a name for HP/L?)<br>
As long as a creature has at least 1 HP, it is healthy enough state to stand up and act as normal. If a creature has 0 or fewer HP... Well, we'll get to that later...<br>

### Damage Types & Resistances
The main way of reducing a creature's HP is by dealing damage. Whenever damage is dealt, the type is specified. This does not inherently come with any drawbacks or benefits, but could be used that way for flavor and fun interactions.<br>
Creatures can have varying amount of Resistance against certain damage types, either innately or granted by Talents and/or certain circumstances.<br>
When a creature takes damage of any given type, reduce the damage they take by their Resistance against that type. A "Weakness" is just a negative Resistance, resulting in more damage being taken. An "Immunity" is treated an unlimited Resistance, which always reduces the damage to 0.<br>
The damage types are sorted into categories for ease of reference. As a design rule, no single roll will deal damage of more than one type from each category.
<br><br>

**Physical**
+ Bludgeoning
+ Piercing
+ Slashing
#### <br>

**Discordant? Mental?**
+ Poison? Toxic?
+ Psychic
+ Sonic
#### <br>

**Elemental**
+ Acid
+ Cold
+ Fire
+ Lightning
#### <br>

**Spiritual**
+ Infernal? Unholy?
+ Necrotic
+ Radiant? Holy?
#### <br>

### Lethal Damage & Death's Door
If a creature takes damage that reduces its HP to 0 or below, that damage is considered Lethal. When a creature takes Lethal damage, its controller decides whether to relinquish their control (by dying or falling unconcious for an indeterminate amount of time, depending on context and the attacker's intent) or remain active on Death's Door.<br>
A creature is considered to be on Death's Door as long as it has 0 or fewer HP without having been taken out.<br>
A creature on Death's Door can't maintain Concentration and has only 1 Action to take per Round. Entering Death's Door wastes unused Actions first, and being brought back from Death's Door doesn't refresh any Actions.<br>

### Exhaustion
Whenever a creature's HP is reduced below 0, its Exhaustion is set to the absolute value of its now negative HP, unless the Exhaustion is already greater.<br>
While a creature has any Exhaustion, subtract is Exhaustion from its Martial Might and Magic Might.<br>
Whenever a creature that has any Exhaustion makes any kind of Test, subtract its Exhaustion from its roll.<br>
A creature can have an amount of Exhaustion up to their Death Threshold and remain active. If a creature's Exhaustion EVER exceeds its Death Threshold, it immidiately dies (or falls unconcious for an indeterminate time, if the GM is feeling merciful).<br>

## Actions
During combat, every second counts, and it is important to know how every moment of every round is spent. <br>
To do this, we use Actions. An adventurer gets 3 Actions at the start of a battle, and regains them *AFTER* finishing their turn. <br>
The details regarding the most common reoccuring options have been pre-defined, but if someone wants to do something not defined, it may still be done, either as part of another action or as an Action on its own. <br>
You may spend these Actions on your turn for whatever task you decide to spend your time to attempt.
<br><br>

Here are some guidelines if you need to improvise:
+ Doing one thing one time = Using 1 Action. It doesn't matter how great the eventual consequences are down the road.
+ If a non-Save Test must be made, it should use Actions.
+ 1 Action = about a second or two of active effort. If it takes longer than that, it should use more than 1 Action and probably be Interruptible.
+ Reactions arenâ€™t improvised. Use "Prepared Actions" instead.
#### <br>

Examples:
+ As part of any Action where you move to a different space, you may open a door as you pass through it, or close it if it was already opened (but not both?). If the door is locked, or you want to lock it behind you, you can't just "move through" without dealing with the situation, so it takes 1 Action to do.
+ As part of any Action that relies on you using an object, you may use a free hand to grab hold of that object if it is easily attainable, such as on your belt or on the ground next to you. You may not both stuff away an object and grab a new one with the freed hand using same action, as that is covered by the Fetch/Search/Equip? Action.
+ As part of any Action, you may ask the GM questions about what your character knows, sees, hears, etc. If you need to make a Test to find something out, it's takes its own Action.
#### <br>

### Pre-Defined Actions

**Attack Action** <br>
Make a Martial Attack, using either your body or an object you are holding in either hand (or drawing/picking up as part of the same action), against a target within your reach or range. <br>
When you score a hit with a Martial Attack, you may do one of the following things:
+ Deal 1* damage to the target. The damage type depends on the nature of the attack, though it is usually Physical.
+ Grapple the target.
+ Shove the target 1* Pace.
+ Knock Down the target (provided it is no larger than you).
+ Knock an object out of the target's grip. (PHRASING?)
#### <br>

*If the Attack is Ranged, it is Interruptible. (PHRASING?)* <br>
*Extended Range: You can attack any target within the defined range as normal. You can attack a target outside that range by increasing the Difficulty by 1 for each pace you exceed the range by.*
<br><br>

**Brace Action** <br>
Prepare for the worst and steel your nerves by using any number of Actions. <br>
Until the start of your next turn, you add a +1 bonus to your Defence, your Awareness, and any Save you make. <br>
*Yes, this can be stacked with itself.*
<br><br>

**Care Action** <br>
Make a Test of Medicine to try and mitigate the damage a severly hurt creature has taken (Difficulty = 10 + target's Exhaustion). <br>
On a success, the creature is regains up to 1* HP. A creature can't be restored above 0 HP this way.<br>
This Action is Interruptible.
<br><br>

**Fetch/Search/Equip/Inventory/Sort? Action** <br>
Stow away and/or grab hold of any number of items you want. <br>
You may reach into one bag or similar container to stow items into/access items from.
This Action is Interruptible.
<br><br>

**Help Action** <br>
If you don't already have a Help Die, declare either "Attack" or the name of a Skill and gain a d6 Help Die until your next turn. *For roleplay reasons, you have to descibe how you are able to help to do so. Have good reasons, and your declaration could be allowed some room for vagueness or generous interpretation*<br>
If you already have a Help Die, increase its size by one stage instead, up to a d12.
<br><br>
When another creature within your reach makes a Test using the Skill you declared, roll your prepared Help Die and add it to their total roll. <br>
Alternatively, if you declared "Attack", when another creature Attacks a target that is within your Reach, you can roll your prepared Help Die and add it to the Attack roll.
<br><br>

**Hide Action** <br>
Choose a creature or a group of creatures from which you are Covered and make a Test of Stealth against the highest Awareness amongst them. On a success, none of the creatures you chose will know where you went. <br>
Your Hiding can end in a *LOT* of different ways, such as you making a noise louder than a whisper or the cover somehow being left/removed/circumvented. (PHRASING?)
*If they want to find you with a Test, such as Investigation or Intuition, what should the Difficulty be? Passive Martial Skill?* <br>
*The Test is made with Disadcantage if the Cover used is only Partial.<br>
*The Test is made with Advantage if your target(s) have not yet been made aware of your presence at all.*
<br><br>

**Move Action** <br>
Pick one of your Speeds. Move to an unoccupied space within the distance of your chosen Speed.<br>
The movement you spend is dynamically affected by Difficult Terrain etc. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)<br>
This Action is normally Interruptible, but you can choose to only gain half the normal movement to prevent this.<br>
You can also make one Check as part of this action to make a tough jump or push through a blockade.<br>
*Making tough jumps: Make a Difficulty 0 Test of Athletics to determine the maximum distances the jump can cover (1* paces horizontally and half as many verically). If you make the jump from using at least 2 Actions worth of movement, you gain Advantage. If you make the jump from standing or "careful movement", you gain Disadvantage.*<br>
*Pushing through blockades: Make a Test of Brawn against the blockade's Hardness (if it's an inanimate object) or Martial Might (if it's a creature). If it's smaller than you, you gain Advantage. If it's larger than you, you gain Disadvantage.*
<br><br>

**Spell Action** <br>
Begin to cast a Spell you have access to through some means. Casting a Spell requires you putting your whole body into it. It is loud, clear, and obvious when a Spell is cast (and most of the time also what spell it is). <br>
If the casting time is not measured in Actions, the Spell cannot be used in combat. <br>
Regardless of which Spell is cast, casting a Spell on your turn is Interruptible. <br>
<br><br>

### Pre-Defined Reactions

**Sudden Strike Reaction**
When a creature within your Reach takes an Interruptible Action, you can use 1 Action to make a Sudden Strike against it. <br>
A Sudden Strike is a single Melee Martial Attack (Improvised or Proper, using whatever the attacker already has equipped). <br>
If the attack hits, the triggering Action(s) are interrupted at the point when the Strike was declared, preventing any events they would cause from that point forwards. The desired on-hit effects of the Attack, such as damage, are applied as normal. <br>
*Note: This doesn't waste any resources, only the Actions themselves. MP, components, ammunition, etc. are all safe.* <br>
*Note: Grappling and Shoving count as attacks, so you can grab or shove someone to prevent them from running.*

**Spell Contribution Reaction**
When another creature within your Reach casts a Spell you know, you can use 1 Action to sjoin in on the casting.<br>
*Read the spellcasting rules for details*

### Reserving/Delaying Actions
To reserve Actions, you first spend the amount of actions needed on your turn and specify a trigger.
Then, if the trigger occurs before your next turn, you spend that many actions again to do the thing.

## Conditions & Common Situations
???

### Cover
Terrain is seldom just an empty floor. So you could be "behind something" or "obscured by something" when viewed from a creature's perspective. <br>
What counts as cover depends on a lot of circumstances regarding both a target and an observer. For example: A Small creature may be Fully Covered by an object that a Medium creature is only Partially Covered by. <br>
A creature may be obscured by darkness, fog, or an *Invisibility* Spell and thus completely obscured to a commoner, but just plainly out in the open to a dragon that has no need to just *see* its target.
<br> <br>
**Partially Covered**
A partially covered creature may be still be targeted, but with Disadvantage. If Disadvantage is already imposed for some other reason, it is NOT an allegable target anymore. <br>
<br><br>
**Fully Covered**
Flatout "Not an allegable target". <br>
Creatures can still tell where you are (due to other senses or a basic understanding of object permanence) unless you actively attempt to *Hide*.

### Defined Conditions
<br><br>
**Blinded** <br>
A Blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on sight. <br>
*Note: Since you can't see, it's like everything is behind a "Full Cover" for you.*
<br><br>
**Charmed** <br>
A Charmed creature is unable to make Attacks against the source of the condition. <br>
Said source also gains Advantage on any Test it makes to socially interact with the creature.
<br><br>
**Deafened** <br>
A Deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on hearing.
<br><br>
**Frightened** <br>
A Frightened creature is unable to make a move that ends in a space closer to the source of the condition than where it started. <br>
The creature also gains Disadvantage on any Test it makes to socially interact with the source of its fear.
<br><br>
**Incapacitated** <br>
An Incapacitated Creature can't use its Actions.
<br><br>
**Poisoned? Sick?** <br>
A Poisoned creature gains Disadvantage on any Test (maybe not Saves?) it makes.
<br><br>
**Stunned** <br>
A Stunned creature is Blinded, Deafened, and Incapacitated. It also can't regain any of its Actions.
<br><br>
**Unconcious** <br>
An Unconcious creature is Blinded, Deafened, and Incapacitated. It also can't regain any of its Actions. It also falls down and can't hold on to anything.

### Other

**Difficult Terrain** <br>
If at least a quarter of the spaces a creature occupies is within a section of Difficult Terrain, it is affected by said terrain. This can result in a plethora of effects depending on the terrain and the source of its difficulty, but it will at least hinder the creature's movement.<br>
Each pace a creature moves whilst hindered by Difficult Terrain counts as having moved 2 paces *(which makes it easy to get into and hard to get out of)*.

**Falling** <br>
If a creature that isn't suspended by standing on solid ground or the ability to fly, it falls. A falling creature will reach the first stable point directly below it at some point.
<br><br>

If the creature fell a distance greater than 1 pace, it takes 1 damage for each pace it fell beyond the first.<br>
If a falling creature lands on some form of cushioning surface, the falling damage is halved. If a creature lands on a different creature no smaller than itself, it counts as cushioning surface.<br>
If a creature is landed on by a creature no smaller than itself, the falling damage is dealt to the creature being landed on as well.
<br><br>

**Holding Breath** <br>
Creatures generally need to breathe. If a creature isn't meeting this need at the end of its turn, it gains 1 Exhaustion.<br>
If a creature is breathing, it can start holding its breath as part of any other Action by making a Difficulty 0 Test of Endurance, bypassing its need to breathe for up to 1* Minutes.
<br><br>

**Downed** <br>
A creature can "down itself" as part of any other action. Smaller "Hitbox". Some Partial Cover can become Full Cover. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)<br>
Whilst a creature is downed, its Speeds are halved.<br>
A downed creature can use 1 Action to stand up. Taking this Action is Interruptible.<br>
An airborne creature that is forcefully knocked down falls to the ground before being downed upon landing, taking falling damage as normal.
<br><br>

**Forced Movement** <br>
When a creature is moved by force, it instantly travels the appropriate number of paces in a straight line determined by said force.<br>
If the intended path of travel is blocked by an obstacle, the creature stops in the last empty space it occupied before the collision and takes 1 damage for each pace of force still untravelled.<br>
Being forcefully pushed into another creature counts as being blocked by an obstacle, but the damage is halved and dealt to both creatures.
<br><br>

**Grappling** <br>
If a creature is grappled by something, it can't move into a new space, and any Attack it makes against a target other than its grappler gains Disadvantage. <br>
Whatever tool or limb is being used to maintain the grapple can't be used for anything else without releasing the grappled creature. <br>
A creature can use 1 Action on its turn to attempt breaking a creatue within its Reach free from being grappled. To do so, it must succeed on a Martial Test against the grappler's Martial Might. <br>
A creature can use 1 Action on its turn to attempt throwing a creature it is grappling. To do so, it must succeed on a Martial Test against the grappled creature's Martial Might (Advantage if the thrower is of a greater size than the thrown, Disadvantage if thrower is of a smaller size than the thrown. Difficulty 0 if the thrown is willing). On a success, the creature is thrown in a straight line up to a distance equal to the thrower's reach times 1*.

# Combat Equipment
???

## Weapons
Weapons are tools meant for combat and therefore improve any Martial Attack you make were you are using it properly. Most commonly, a weapon will state that is uses a specific Attribute, in which case you aren't using the weapon properly unless you're making an Attack using that Attribute.<br>
The exact requirements for what counts as "wielding a weapon properly" and the benefits for doing so are determined by the weapon's various properties. You must follow every restriction to gain every benefit. There's no partial credit.<br>
If you lack the Proficiency associated with a given weapon, using a weapon properly becomes more difficult. You can still follow the restrictions and gain the benefits, but you gain Disadvantage on the Attack.

#### <br>

### Weapon Properties

**Two-Handed:** To properly use a Two-Handed weapon to make an Attack, you must be wielding it with both hands.
<br><br>

**Off-Handed:** After you make a Martial Attack on your turn, you can properly use an Off-Handed weapon you're already wielding to make a single Martial Attack, provided that the first attack was not made using it.<br>
After doing so, you can't do so again until you've regained your Actions.
<br><br>

**Reach (X):** Your reach for Martial Melee Attacks attacks properly using a Reach weapon extends to become no shorter than the given value. *(If made at larger scales, multiply X by the intended wielder's reach)*.
<br><br>

**Thrown (X):** You can throw a Thrown weapon at a target using the given range and it will still count as using it properly. *(If made at larger scales, multiply X by the intended wielder's reach)*
<br><br>

**Ranged (X):** To use a Ranged weapon properly, you must use it to make a Ranged Martial Attack against using the given range. *(If made at larger scales, multiply X by the intended wielder's reach)*
<br><br>

**Ammunition (X)** To use an Ammunition weapon properly, you must provide a of the specified type of ammunition. After the attack is made, the used piece of ammunition is lost.
<br><br>

**Loading (X):** To use a Loading weapon properly, it must've been loaded beforehand. After being loaded, it can be used to make up to the given number of Attacks before it must be loaded again. To load a weapon takes 1 Action. We can generally assume that all weapons are fully loaded before entering a new Action Scene.
<br><br>

**Bash:** You may also shove the target up to a number of space away from you equal to the damage dealt. If you do, you may also move up to the same distance along the same path.
<br><br>

## Shields
If you are wielding a shield when an Attack is made against you or a target entirely within your reach, you can use 1 Action to Block, adding a bonus to the target's Defence against that attack, potentially changing the outcome. *(NOTE: You will naturally be entirely within your own reach)*<br>
Each type of shield is categorized as either Small or Large. If you don't have Proficiency with the category of a shield you are wielding, you can't use it to Block.<br>
You can also use a shield as a weapon, following the rules of weapon usage as normal. *(Disadvantage on if you lack proficiency)*<br>

### Small
+ Buckler: Damage (1* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (1d6 Defence).
+ Targe: Uses Strength. Damage (2* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (1d8 Defence).
#### <br>

### Large
+ Heater: Uses Strength. Damage (2* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (1d8 Defence). Bulky.
+ Tower: Uses Strength. Damage (3* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (1d10 Defence). Bulky. Hefty. On Block, creates Cover between the Attacker and its target. Partial for triggering attack, and full therafter. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)
#### <br>

### Shield Properties
**Bulky?:** A Bulky shield always adds to the wielder's Defence. When used to Block an Attack aimed at another creature, the Attack is redirected to the wielder instead.<br>
**Hefty:** To use a Hefty shield to Attack or Block takes 2 Actions instead?<br>

## Armor
Each type of armor has a defined Protection Value that you add to the Defence of anyone who is weaing it. <br>
Characters have an inventory slot for the armor they are wearing. Needless to say, you can't wear multiple suits of armor at once. <br>
Any given set of armor is categorized as either Light or Heavy. If you don't have Proficiency with the category of the armor you are wearing, it Encumbers you.

### Light
+ Hide (Novice): 2 Protection
+ Gambeson (Regular): 3 Protection
+ Brigandine (Grand): 4 Protection
#### <br>

### Heavy
+ Chain (Novice): 2 Protection, Cumbersome (-1), Resistance (1 one Physical).
+ Splint (Regular): 3 Protection, Cumbersome (-2), Resistance (1 two Physical).
+ Plate (Grand): 4 Protection, Cumbersome (-3), Resistance (1 all Physical).
#### <br>

### Armor Properties
**Cumbersome (X):** The wearer applies the given penalty to any Test they make using Agility. *(includeas Saves, Attacks, and Skills)*
**Resistance (X Damage Type):** Increases the wearer's Resistances by the given amount against the given damage type.

## Senses?
You use your senses to percieve the world. If you have a special sense, you can use it to determine your total Awareness, along with whatever other perks it brings. <br>
There are a few specific types of equipment or spells that can grant a creature a sense, but usually it will be derived from biology. <br>
*NOTE: The functions listed below are all VERY MUCH NOT set in stone.* <br>

+ Darkvision? Nightsight?: 2 Perception. You can see in complete darkness as if it were only dim light, and in dim light as if it were fully lit. *NOTE: This mitigates light-based obscurement*
+ Blindsight? "vibes"?: 3 Perception. You can tell what is going on at all times without needing to use your senses normally? *NOTE: This negates light-based obscurement entirely*
+ Truesight?: 4 Perception. You can tell the exact nature of all things at a glance? (PHRASING?) *NOTE: This counters illusions and transformations*
#### <br>
