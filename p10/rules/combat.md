### Lethal Damage & Death's Door
If a creature takes damage that reduces its HP to 0, that damage is considered Lethal. When a creature takes Lethal damage, the attacker decides whether to kill that creature or just "take it out". Some creatures, for example player characters, should however not be that easy to defeat. When a such a creature takes Lethal damage, whether the attacker intends to "take them out" or outright kill them, it instead gains 1 point of exhaustion and enter the state of "Death's Door".

A creature on Death's Door is Incapacitated and must make a Death Roll at the start of each of its turns. To make a Death Roll, Roll your Hit Die. If the result is higher than your Exhaustion, you retain your Exhaustion and are still at 0 HP, but you no longer on Death's Door. Otherwise, your Exhaustion increases by 1 and you remain on Death's Door. <br>
You are not defeated (whether killed or "taken out") until it gains its sixth Exhaustion.
