## Rounds and Turns
???

## HP & Damage
A creature's hardiness is determined by its Hit Die (Which is determined by Size for most monsters, but by Class for players) and expressed in the form of Hit Points, or HP for short. <br>
As long as a creature has at least 1 remaining HP, it is not dead or dying and able to act normally. A player's Maximum HP is equal to the size of their Hit Die times their Level.

### Lethal Damage & Death's Door
If a creature takes damage that reduces its HP to 0, that damage is considered Lethal. When a creature takes Lethal damage, the attacker decides whether to kill that creature or just "take it out", potentially leaving the target unconcious for an indeterminate amount of time. Either way, the fate of the creature is no longer up to it, but rather its attacker and other surrounding circumstances. <br>
Some creatures should not be that easy to defeat however, the main example being *PLAYER CHARACTERS*. When a such a creature takes Lethal damage, it is instead left on "Death's Door".
<br><br>
A creature is considered to be on Death's Door as long as it has 0 HP without being dead or otherwise taken out. <br>
A creature on Death's Door can't maintain Concentration, ??? <br>
When a creature on Death's Door takes any amount of damage, it gains 1 Exhaustion. <br>
When a creature on Death's Door uses Actions, it gains 1 Exhaustion for each Action used. <br>
A creature can have up to 5 points of Exhaustion without any directly adverse effects. But if a creature would gain any more, it is defeated, whether that means killed or "taken out". <br>
*Should Death Rolls be a thing? If they are, they are made by rolling your Hit Die and needing to exceed your current Exhaustion.*

## Actions
During combat, every second counts, and it is important to know how every moment of every round is spent. <br>
To do this, we use Actions. An adventurer gets 3 Actions at the start of a battle, and regains them *AFTER* finishing their turn. <br>
The details regarding the most common reoccuring options have been pre-defined, but if someone wants to do something not defined, it may still be done, either as part of another action or as an Action on its own. <br>
You may spend these Actions on your turn for whatever task you decide to spend your time to attempt.
<br><br>
Here are some guidelines if you need to improvise:
+ Doing a thing one time = Using one action. It doesn't matter how much the thing could affect.
+ If it's on your turn and a Test is required, it should probably use an Action.
+ 1 Action = about a second or two of active effort. If it takes longer than that, it should use more than 1 Action and probably be Distracting.
+ Reactions arenâ€™t improvised. Use "Prepared Actions" instead.
#### <br>

Examples:
+ As part of any Action where you move to a different space, you may open a door as you pass through it, or close it if it was already opened (but not both?). If the door is locked, or you want to lock it behind you, you can't just "move through" without dealing with the situation, so it takes 1 Action to do.
+ As part of any Action that relies on you using an object, you may use a free hand to grab hold of that object if it is easily attainable, such as on your belt or on the ground next to you. You may not both stuff away an object and grab a new one with the freed hand using same action, as that is covered by the Fetch/Search/Equip? Action.
+ As part of any Action, you may ask the GM questions about what your character knows, sees, hears, etc. If you need to make a Test to find something out, it's its own Action.
#### <br>

### Pre-Defined Actions

**Attack Action** <br>
Make a Martial Attack, using either your body or an object you are holding in either hand (or drawing/picking up as part of the same action). <br>
If the Attack is using a proper weapon the way it is intended, all rules granted by the weapon's properties apply.
If the Attack is not using a weapon (proper or improvised) and/or using a weapon improperly, it counts an an Unarmed Strike. When you score a hit with an Unarmed Strike, you may either deal the target 1 damage (Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing depending on context), grapple it, or shove it out of your Reach.
If the Attack is a Ranged Attack, this Action is Distracting. <br>
*A thrown objects counts as an improvised weapon. Throwing it at someone counts a Ranged(20/60) Martial Attack dealing 1 die of damage on hit. Damage die and damage type (Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing) depends on the size and shape of the object.*<br>
*Critical Hits: Always deals the maximum possible damage, and the user may redistribute any access damage dealt?*<br>
<br><br>

**Brace Action** <br>
Prepare for the worst and steel your nerves by using any number of Actions. <br>
Until the start of your next turn, you add a +1 bonus to your Defence, Awareness, and any Save you make for each Action used.
<br><br>

**Care Action** <br>
Make a Medicine Check to try and stabilize a creature on Death's Door (Difficulty = 10 + Exhaustion). <br>
On a success, the creature is stabilized/regains 1 HP/succeeds on a Death Roll? (DETAILS?)
Taking this Action is Distracting.
<br><br>

**Fetch/Search/Equip/Inventory? Action** <br>
Stow away and/or grab hold of any number of items you want. <br>
You may reach into one bag or similar container to stow items into/access items from. <br>
Taking this Action is Distracting.
<br><br>

**Hide Action** <br>
Choose a creature or a group of creatures from which you are fully covered and make a Stealth Check against the highest Awareness amongst them. On a success, none of the creatures you chose will know where you went. <br>
Your Hiding can end in a *LOT* of different ways, such as you making a noise louder than a whisper or the cover somehow being left/removed/circumvented.
*If they want to find you with a check, such as Investigation or Intuition, what should the Difficulty be? Passive Martial Skill?*
<br><br>

**Move Action** <br>
Pick one of your speeds. Move to an unoccupied space within the distance of your chosen speed. <br>
Your movement is dynamically affected by difficult terrain etc. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
You can also make checks/one check? as part of this action to cover a greater distance, make a tough jump, and/or push through a blockade. Making a Check this way is Distracting. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
*Moving greater distances: Make an Athletics Check. You add a number of feet to your movement equal to your result. The entire running distance is Distracting. If any part is made through Difficult Terrain, you gain Disadvantage.* <br>
*Making tough jumps: Make an Athletics Check. A horizontal jump covers a number of feet equal to your result. A vertical jump covers a number of feet equal to your result divided by 4. If you don't get a good running start, you gain Disadvantage.* <br>
*Pushing through blockades: Make a Brawn Check against the blockade's Hardness (if it is an inanimate object) or Passive Martial Skill (if it is a creature). If it's at least one Size smaller than you, you gain Advantage. If it's at least one Size larger than you, you gain Disadvantage.*
<br><br>

**Spell Action** <br>
Begin to cast a Spell you have some access to. Casting a Spell requires you putting your whole body into it. It is loud, clear, and obvious when a Spell is cast (and often also what spell it is). <br>
If the Spell requires more than 1 Action to cast, doing so is Distracting. If the casting time is even longer (Minute = ~10 rounds, Hour = ~100 rounds), it requires all of your actions *every round* that entire time.
<br><br>

### Pre-Defined Reactions

**Strike Reaction**
When a creature within your Reach takes a Distracting Action, you may make a Sudden Strike against it. <br>
A Sudden Strike is a single Melee Martial Attack (Unarmed or Weapon, using whatever the attacker has available). If the attack hits, the triggering Action is interrupted and do not occur. <br>
*Note: This doesn't waste resources. Only the Actions themselves. Spell Slots, components, and equipment are all safe.*

### Reserving/Delaying Actions
To reserve Actions, you first spend the amount of actions needed on your turn and specify a trigger.
Then, if the trigger occurs before your next turn, you spend that many actions again to do the thing.

## Conditions & Common Situations
???

### Cover
Terrain is seldom just an empty floor. So you could be "behind something" or "obscured by something" when viewed from a creature's perspective. <br>
What counts as cover depends on a lot of circumstances regarding both a target and an observer. For example: A Small creature may be Fully Covered by an object that a Medium creature is only Partially Covered by. A creature may be obscured by darkness, fog, or an *Invisibility* Spell and thus fully obscured to a commoner, but just plainly out in the open to a dragon with no need to just *see* its target.
<br> <br>
**Partially Covered**
A partially covered creature may be still be targeted, but with Disadvantage. If Disadvantage is already imposed for some other reason, it is NOT an allegable target anymore. <br>
<br><br>
**Fully Covered**
Flatout "Not an allegable target".<br>
Creatures can still tell where you are (due to other senses or a basic understanding of object permanence) unless you actively attempt to *hide*.

### Defined Conditions
<br><br>
**Blinded** <br>
A Blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on sight. <br>
*Note: Since you can't see, it's like everything is behind a "Full Cover" for you.*
<br><br>
**Charmed** <br>
A Charmed creature is unable to make Attacks against the source of the condition. <br>
Said source also gains Advantage on any Check it makes to socially interact with the creature.
<br><br>
**Deafened** <br>
A Deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on hearing.
<br><br>
**Frightened** <br>
A Frightened creature is unable to make a move that ends in a space closer to the source of the condition than where it started. <br>
The creature also gains Disadvantage on any Check it makes to socially interact with the source of its fear.
<br><br>
**Incapacitated** <br>
An Incapacitated Creature can't take Actions.
<br><br>
**Sick** <br>
A Sick creature gains Disadvantage on any Test (maybe not Saves?) it makes.
<br><br>
**Stunned** <br>
A Stunned creature is Incapacitated. Extra penalties?
<br><br>
**Unconcious** <br>
An Unconcious creature is Incapacitated. Extra penalties?

### Other
**Concentration** <br>
A creature can maintain Concentration on at most one thing at a time. <br>
When a Concentrating creature takes damage, it must make a Strength Save (Difficulty = damage taken). <br>
On a failed Save, its Concentration is broken. <br>
**Falling** <br>
If a creature that isn't suspended by standing on solid ground, or the ability to fly, it falls. <br>
A falling creature will reach the first stable point directly below it by the end of its next turn (AKA current if you fall on your own turn?) <br>
Upon landing, the creature takes 1 die of damage for every 10 feet it fell. The size of the die is determined by the Size of the creature (Tiny = d4, Small = d6, Medium = d8, Large = d10, Huge = d12, Gargantuan = d20). <br>
If it lands on a cushoning surface, the damage is halved. If that surface consists one or more creatures, each of those creatures also take the already halved damage. (Agility Save involved for landing and/or being landed on? PHRASING?)
**Downed/Knocked Down** <br>
Smaller "Hitbox". Some Partial Cover can become Full Cover. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
Whilst downed, your Speed is halved. <br>
A downed creature can use 1 Action to stand up. Taking this Action is Distracting. <br>
A flying creature that is knocked down falls until it hits the ground and takes fall damage from it.
**Grappling** <br>
If a creature has another creature grappled, the grappled creature can't move to a new space, and any attack it makes against a target other than its grappler gains Disadvantage. <br>
The grappled creature can use 1 Action on its turn to make a Martial Check against the grappler's Passive Martial Skill, freeing itself on a success.
