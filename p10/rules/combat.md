# Combat Rules

## Rounds and Turns

## Staying Alive
A creature's hardiness is expressed in the form of Hit Points, or HP for short.<br>
As long as a creature has at least 1 HP, it is healthy enough state to stand up and act as normal. If a creature has 0 or fewer HP... Well, we'll get to that later...<br>

### Damage Types & Resistances
The main way of reducing a creature's HP is by dealing damage. Whenever damage is dealt, the type is specified. This does not inherently come with any drawbacks or benefits, but could be used that way for flavor and fun interactions.<br>
Creatures can have varying amount of Resistance against certain damage types, either innately or granted by Talents and/or certain circumstances.<br>
When a creature takes damage of any given type, reduce the damage they take by their Resistance against that type. A "Weakness" is just a negative Resistance, resulting in more damage being taken. An "Immunity" is treated an unlimited Resistance, which always reduces the damage to 0.<br>
The damage types are sorted into categories for ease of reference. As a design rule, no single roll will deal damage of more than one type from each category.
<br><br>

**Physical**
+ Bludgeoning
+ Piercing
+ Slashing
#### <br>

**Dissonant**
+ Poison? Toxic?
+ Psychic
+ Sonic
#### <br>

**Elemental**
+ Acid
+ Cold
+ Fire
+ Lightning
#### <br>

**Spiritual**
+ Infernal? Unholy? Corrupting?
+ Necrotic
+ Radiant? Holy? Smithing?
#### <br>

### Lethal Damage & Death's Door
If a creature takes damage that reduces its HP to 0 or below, that damage is considered Lethal. When a creature takes Lethal damage, its controller decides whether to relinquish their control (by dying or falling unconcious for an indeterminate amount of time, depending on context and the attacker's intent) or remain active on Death's Door.<br>
A creature is considered to be on Death's Door as long as it has 0 or fewer HP without having been taken out.<br>
A creature on Death's Door can't maintain Concentration and only regains up to 1 Action per Round.<br>
When a creature enters Death Door, it instantly loses Actions until it has no more than 1 remaining.<br>

### Exhaustion
Whenever a creature's HP is reduced below 0, its Exhaustion is set to the absolute value of its now negative HP, unless the Exhaustion is already greater.<br>
Whenever a creature that has any Exhaustion makes any kind of Test, subtract its Exhaustion from its total roll.<br>
A creature can have an amount of Exhaustion up to their Death Threshold and remain active. If a creature's Exhaustion EVER exceeds its Death Threshold, it immidiately dies (or falls unconcious for an indeterminate time, if the GM is feeling merciful).<br>

## Actions
During combat, every second counts, and it is important to know how every moment of every round is spent. To do this, we use Actions. Each creature gains a fresh set of Actions at the start of the Action Scene, each with an associated die. A creature regains any Actions it has used up *AFTER* finishing its turn.<br>
The details regarding the most common reoccuring options have been pre-defined, but if someone wants to do something not defined, it may still be done, either as part of another action or as an Action on its own.<br>
You may spend these Actions on your turn for whatever task you decide to spend your time to attempt.<br><br>

Here are some guidelines if you need to improvise:
+ Doing one thing one time = Using one action. It doesn't matter how much the thing could end up affecting down the road.
+ If a non-Save Test is made, it should use an Action.
+ 1 Action = about a second or two of active effort. If it takes longer than that, it should use more than 1 Action and probably be Interruptible.
+ Don't act outside of your turn. Instead, *REACT* to what's happening by responding or contributing.
#### <br>

Examples:
+ As part of any Action where you move to a different space, you may open a door as you pass through it, or close it if it was already opened (but not both?). If the door is locked, or you want to lock it behind you, you can't just "move through" without dealing with the situation, so it takes 1 Action to do.
+ As part of any Action that relies on you using an object, you may use a free hand to grab hold of that object if it is easily attainable, such as on your belt or on the ground next to you. You may not both stuff away an object and grab a new one with the freed hand using same action, as that is covered by the Fetch/Search/Equip? Action.
+ As part of any Action, you may ask the GM questions about what your character knows, sees, hears, etc. If you need to make a Test to find something out, it's takes its own Action.
#### <br>

### Pre-Defined Actions

#### Attack Action
Make a Martial Attack, using either your body or an object you are holding in either hand (or drawing/picking up as part of the same action).<br>
It must be either a Melee Attack against a target within your reach, or a Range Attack (which is interruptible).<br>
When you score a hit with a Martial Attack, you may do one of the following things:
+ Deal 1* damage to the target. The (normally Physical) type of the damage dealt depends is decided based on vibes.
+ Grapple the target.
+ Shove the target 1 Pace.
+ Knock Down the target (provided it is no larger than you).
+ Knock an object out of the target's grip. (PHRASING?)
#### <br>

*Extended Range: You can attack any target within the given range (your Throwing Range unless otherwise specified) as normal. You can attack a target outside that range by increasing the Difficulty by 1 for each pace the distance exceeds the range by.*

#### Brace Action
Prepare for the worst and steel your nerves by using any number of Actions. <br>
Until you've regained the Action, you add a +1 bonus to your Defence, your Awareness, and any Save you make. <br>
*Yes, this can be stacked with itself.*
<br><br>

#### Care Action
Make a Test of Medicine to try and mitigate the damage a severly hurt creature has taken (Difficulty = 10 + target's Exhaustion). <br>
On a success, the creature is regains up to 1* HP. A creature can't be restored above 0 HP this way.<br>
This Action is Interruptible.

#### Fetch/Search/Equip/Inventory/Sort? Action**
Stow away and/or grab hold of any number of items you want.<br>
You may reach into one bag or similar container to stow items into/access items from.
This Action is Interruptible.

#### Hide Action
Choose a creature or a group of creatures from which you are Covered and make a Test of Stealth against the highest Awareness amongst them. On a success, none of the creatures you chose will know where you went. <br>
Your Hiding can end in a *LOT* of different ways, such as you making a noise louder than a whisper or the cover somehow being left/removed/circumvented. (PHRASING?)
*If they want to find you with a check, such as Investigation or Intuition, what should the Difficulty be? Passive Martial Skill?* <br>
*Your Stealth Test is made with Advantage if your target(s) have not yet been made aware of your presence.*
<br><br>

#### Move Action
Pick one of your Speeds. Move to an unoccupied space within the distance of your chosen Speed.<br>
The movement you spend is dynamically affected by Difficult Terrain etc. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)<br>
This Action is normally Interruptible, but you can choose to only gain half the normal movement to prevent this.<br>
You can also make one Check as part of this action to make a tough jump or push through a blockade.<br>
*Making tough jumps: Make a Difficulty 0 Test of Athletics to determine the maximum distances the jump can cover (1* paces horizontally and half as many verically). If you make the jump from using at least 2 Actions worth of movement, you gain Advantage. If you make the jump from standing or "careful movement", you gain Disadvantage.*<br>
*Pushing through blockades: Make a Test of Brawn against the blockade's Hardness (if it's an inanimate object) or Martial Might (if it's a creature). If it's smaller than you, you gain Advantage. If it's larger than you, you gain Disadvantage.*

#### Spell Action
Begin to cast a Spell you have access to through some means. Casting a Spell requires you putting your whole body into it. It is loud, clear, and obvious when a Spell is cast (and most of the time also what spell it is).<br>
If the casting time is not measured in Actions, the Spell cannot be used in combat.<br>
Regardless of which Spell is cast, casting a Spell on your turn is Interruptible.

### Pre-Defined Reactions

#### Assist Reaction
When another creature within your reach makes a Test, you can use Actions to add their Action Dice to its Dice Pool.<br>
*For roleplay reasons, you have to descibe how your efforts are helping to do so. Have good reasons, and your declaration could be allowed some room for vagueness or generous interpretation*
<br><br>
Alternatively, when a allied creature makes an Attack against a target that is within your Reach, you can roll your prepared Help Die and add it to the Attacker's Dice Pool.

#### Evade Reaction
When you are targeted by an Attack, you can use Actions to roll their Action Dice and subract the sum from the incoming Attack's roll.<br>
*Non-players normally don't use this reaction. Hardy monsters don't need to, instead saving their actions for bigger things, and opponents without advanced combat training don't know how to.*<br>
*If an opponent IS employing advanced combat training, this might be used extensively >:)*

#### Sudden Strike Reaction
When a creature within your Reach takes an Interruptible Action or attempts to move into a new space, you can use 1 Action to make a Sudden Strike against it.<br>
A Sudden Strike is a single Martial Melee Attack, either Improvised or Proper, using whatever the attacker already has equipped.<br>
If the attack hits, the triggering event interrupted at the point when the Strike was declared, preventing any events they would cause from that point forwards. The desired on-hit effects of the Attack, such as damage, are applied as normal.<br>
*Note: This doesn't waste any resources, only the Actions themselves. MP, components, ammunition, etc. are all safe.*<br>
*Note: Grappling and Shoving count as attacks, so you can grab or shove someone to prevent them from running.*

#### Spell Contribution Reaction
When another creature within your Reach casts a Spell you know, you can use Actions to join in on the casting.<br>
*Read the spellcasting rules for details*

## Conditions & Common Situations
???

### Obscurement
If a creature has trouble seeing the thing they target, whether because of bad weather, poor lighting, or camouflage, that target is considered Obscured from that creature's perspective. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)
When a creature makes a Test targeting something that is Obscured from them, each Action Die is rolled with Disadvantage.

### Cover
Terrain is seldom just an empty floor. So you could be "behind something" when viewed from a creature's perspective.<br>
What counts as cover depends on a lot of circumstances regarding both a target and an observer. For example: A Small creature can duck and be Fully Covered by an object that a standing Medium creature isn't covered by at all.

#### Partially Covered
A target is considered to be Partially Covered if it is behind an incomplete barrier, such as one with clear gaps or one that only covers half the target, from the observer's view.<br>
A Partially Covered target may still be directly targeted, but the Difficulty of any Attack made against it is increased by 5.

#### Fully Covered
A target is considered to be Fully Covered only if it is "behind a solid wall" from the observer's view.
A Fully Covered target or space can't be directly targeted.<br>
Creatures already aware of a Fully Covered target will still know where it is (due to other senses or a basic understanding of object permanence) unless it actively attempts to *Hide*.

### Defined Conditions

#### Blinded
A Blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on sight.<br>
*Note: Unless it has a different sense powerful enough to compensate for its lack of sight, this means that everything is Obscured.*

#### Charmed
A Charmed creature is unable to make Attacks directly targeting the source of the condition.<br>
Whenever the source of the condition rolls an Attribute die to socially interact with a creature charmed by it, it rolls that die with Advantage.

#### Deafened
A Deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any Test made that entirely relies on hearing.

#### Frightened
A Frightened creature is unable to make a move that ends in a space closer to the source of the condition compared to the space it started.<br>
Whenever the Frightened creature rolls an Attribute die to socially interact with the source of its fear, it rolls that die with Disadvantage.

#### Incapacitated
An Incapacitated Creature can't use its Actions.

#### Poisoned? Sick?
A Poisoned creature gains Disadvantage on any Action Die it rolls.

#### Stunned
A Stunned creature is Blinded, Deafened, and Incapacitated. It also can't regain any of its Actions.

#### Unconcious
An Unconcious creature is Blinded, Deafened, and Incapacitated. It also can't regain any of its Actions. It also falls down and can't hold on to anything. Its Defence and Awareness are treated as though they were 0.

### Other
**Concentration** <br>
When a creature begins concentrating, its Stress is set to its Starting Stress. <br>
When a Concentrating creature takes damage, it must add the damage taken to its Stress and make a Will Save against the new value. <br>
A creature can maintain Concentration on no more than one thing at a time. <br>
<br><br>

**Falling** <br>
If a creature that isn't suspended by standing on solid ground or the ability to fly, it falls. <br>
A falling creature will reach the first stable point directly below it by the time it regains its Actions. <br>
Upon landing, the creature takes 1 damage for each pace it fell, ignoring ones that are "covered by a jump". ()<br>
<br>
If a falling creature lands on a more cushoning surface, the damage is halved. <br>
Landing on other creatures counts as landing on a cushioning surface. Each creature involved takes resulting damage.
<br><br>

**Downed/Knocked Down** <br>
A creature can "Down itself" as part of any other action. Smaller "Hitbox". Some Partial Cover can become Full Cover. (PHRASING? DETAILS?) <br>
Whilst a creature is downed, its Speeds are halved. <br>
A downed creature can use 1 Action to stand up. Taking this Action is Interruptible. <br>
A flying creature that is forcefully knocked down will fall until it hits the ground. It takes fall damage as normal.
<br><br>

**Pushing/Throwing** <br>
When a creature is moved by force, it instantly travels the appropriate number of paces in a straight line determined by said force. (PHRASING? horizontal only)<br>
If the intended path of travel is blocked by an obstacle, the creature stops in the last empty space it occupied before the collision and takes 1 damage for each pace of the intended path it didn't travel.<br>
Being forcefully pushed into another creature counts as being blocked by an obstacle, but the damage is halved and dealt to both creatures.
<br><br>

**Grappling** <br>
If a creature is grappled by something, it can't move into a new space, and any attack it makes against a target other than its grappler gains Disadvantage. <br>
Whatever is being used to maintain the grapple (such as a tool or a limb) can't be used for anything else without releasing the grappled creature. <br>
A creature can use 1 Action on its turn to attempt breaking itself or another creature within its Reach free from a grapple. To do so, it must succeed on a Martial Test against the grappler's Martial Might. <br>
A creature can use 1 Action on its turn to attempt throwing a creature it is grappling up to its base throwing range. To do so, it must succeed on a Martial Test against the grappled creature's Martial Might (Advantage if thrower is bigger, Disadvantage if thrower is smaller). Each degree of success increases the maximum distance by 1 pace. Successful or not, the creature is released from the grapple.
<br><br>

# Combat Equipment
???

## Proficiencies
If you lack Proficiency with a weapon, you roll your Combat Skill Die with Disadvantage when trying to use its properly.<br>
If you lack Proficiency with a armor, you are Encumbered whilst wearing armor of that type.<br>
If you lack Proficiency with a shield, you can't use a shield of that type to Block?<br>
If you lack Proficiency with a focus, you roll your Combat Skill Die with Disadvantage when casting a Spell you cast through it.

## Weapons
Weapons are tools meant for combat and therefore improve any Martial Attack you make were you are using it properly. Most commonly, a weapon will state that is uses a specific Attribute, in which case you aren't using the weapon properly unless you're making an Attack using that Attribute.<br>
The exact requirements for what counts as "wielding a weapon properly" and the benefits for doing so are determined by the weapon's various properties. You must follow every restriction to gain every benefit. There's no partial credit.<br>
If you lack the Proficiency associated with a given weapon, using a weapon properly becomes more difficult. You can still follow the restrictions and gain the benefits, but you can't add your Proficiency Die to your Dice Pool.

### Weapon Properties
+ **Damage (X):** When you deal damage with a Martial Attack properly using a Damage weapon, the damage dealt becomes the specified value and damage type.
+ **Two-Handed:** To properly use a Two-Handed weapon to make an Attack, you must be wielding it with both hands.
+ **Off-Handed:** After taking the Attack Action on your turn and using a different weapon, you can use an Off-Handed weapon to make a single Martial Attack using your Bonus Action Die, provided you use it properly when making the attack. After doing so, you can't do so again until you've regained your Actions.
+ **Reach (X):** Your reach for Martial Melee Attacks attacks properly using a Reach weapon extends to become no shorter than the given value. *(If made at larger scales, multiply X by the intended wielder's reach)*.
+ **Thrown (X):** You can throw a Thrown weapon at a target to make a Martial Range Attack using the given range and it will still count as using it properly. *(If scaled up, multiply X by the intended wielder's reach)*
+ **Ranged (X):** To use a Ranged weapon properly, you must use it to make a Martial Range Attack using the given range. *(If scaled up, multiply X by the intended wielder's reach)*
+ **Ammunition (X)** To use an Ammunition weapon properly, you must provide a piece of the specified type of ammunition. After the attack is made, the used piece of ammunition is lost.
+ **Loading (X):** To use a Loading weapon properly, it must've been loaded beforehand. After being loaded, it can be used to make up to the given number of Attacks before it must be loaded again. To load a weapon takes 1 Action. We can generally assume that all weapons are fully loaded before entering a new Action Scene.
+ **Bash:** When you hit a target with a Martial Attack properly using a Bash weapon, you may also shove the target up to 1* paces away from you. If you do, you may also move up to the same distance along the same path.

### Typical Enchantments
A magical weapon normally awaits a worthy creature to wield and attune to it, granting access to spells and/or other supernatural abilities for the attuned to use. A creature should *at least* be proficient with the weapon in question to be worthy of attuning to it.<br>
In addition, a magical weapon will typically deal 1 more damage than its mundane variant, either by increasing the Physical damage or by adding 1 non-Physical damage on hit.

## Shields
If you are wielding a shield when an Attack is made against you or a target entirely within your reach, you can use 1 Action to Block, adding a bonus to the target's Defence against that attack, potentially changing the outcome. *(NOTE: You will naturally be entirely within your own reach)*<br>
Each type of shield is categorized as either Small or Large. If you don't have Proficiency with the category of a shield you are wielding, you can't use it to Block.<br>
You can also use a shield as a weapon, following the rules of proper weapon usage as normal.

### Small
+ Buckler: Damage (1* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (+1).
+ Targe: Uses Strength. Damage (2* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (+2). Hefty (6)

### Large
+ Heater: Uses Strength. Damage (2* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (+2). Hefty (8). Bulky. Can be used to create Partial Cover.
+ Tower: Uses Strength. Damage (3* Bludgeoning). Bash. Block (+3). Hefty (10). Bulky. Can be used to create Full Cover.

### Shield Properties
+ **Block (X):** When you use a Block shield to Block, add the specified bonus to your roll?.
+ **Hefty (X):** To use a Hefty shield to Attack or Block, the combined size of the Action Dice used must be at least X.
+ **Bulky?:** A Bulky shield always adds to the wielder's Defence. When used to Block an Attack aimed at creature other than the wielder, the Attack is redirected to the wielder instead.

## Armor
Each type of armor has a defined Protection Value that you add to the Defence of anyone who is weaing it.<br>
Characters have an inventory slot for the armor they are wearing. Needless to say, you can't wear multiple suits of armor at once. <br>
Any given set of armor is categorized as either Light or Heavy. If you don't have Proficiency with the category of the armor you are wearing, it Encumbers you.

### Light
+ **Hide (Novice):** 1 Protection
+ **Gambeson (Regular):** 2 Protection
+ **Brigandine (Grand):** 3 Protection

### Heavy
+ **Chain (Novice):** 1 Protection, Cumbersome (-1), Resistance (1, one Physical).
+ **Splint (Regular):** 2 Protection, Cumbersome (-2), Resistance (1, two Physical).
+ **Plate (Grand):** 3 Protection, Cumbersome (-3), Resistance (1, all Physical).

### Armor Properties
+ **Cumbersome (X):** The wearer applies the given penalty to any Test of Agility they make, including Attacks and Saves.
+ **Resistance (X Damage Type):** Increases the wearer's Resistances by the given amount against the given damage type.

### Typical Enchantments
A set of magical armor awaits a worthy creature to wear and attune to it, granting access to spells and/or other supernatural abilities for the attuned to use. A creature should *at least* be proficient with the armor in question to be worthy of attuning to it.<br>
In addition, a set of magical armor will typically grant an attuned wearer additional Protection and/or resistance or immunities to specific damage types.

## Senses?
You use your senses to percieve the world. If you have a special sense, you can use it to determine your total Awareness, along with whatever other perks it brings. <br>
There are a few specific types of equipment or spells that can grant a creature a sense, but usually it will be derived from biology. <br>
*NOTE: The functions listed below are all VERY MUCH NOT set in stone.* <br>

+ Darkvision? Nightsight?: 2 Perception. You can see in complete darkness as if it were only dim light, and in dim light as if it were fully lit. *NOTE: This mitigates light-based obscurement*
+ Blindsight? "vibes"?: 3 Perception. You can tell what is going on at all times without needing to use your senses normally? *NOTE: This negates light-based obscurement entirely*
+ Truesight?: 4 Perception. You can tell the exact nature of all things at a glance? (PHRASING?) *NOTE: This counters illusions and transformations*
