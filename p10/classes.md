## Pick your class
Your class is the way you are an adventurer. It defines most of your features.
<br>

**Warriors**
As an adventurer, combat against monsters is inevitable. The warrior classes are always as ready they can be to throw down. <br>
For this test, the [Fighter](/p10/class/fighter) is a purebred warrior, and the [Ranger](/p10/class/ranger) is a warrior/expert hybrid.

**Experts**
Not all problems are creatures to kill, and not all problem creatures are solved by killing them. Experts are always prepared to tackle such issues in various ways. <br>
For this test, the [Rogue](/p10/class/rogue) is a purebred warrior, and the [Bard](/p10/class/bard) is an expert/mage hybrid.

**Mages**
Magic is the ability to turn imagination real and make the impossible possible. It's useful for both combat or non-combat purposes, but it'll be costly either way. <br>
For this test, the [Wizard](/p10/class/wizard) is a purebred warrior, and the [Cleric](/p10/class/cleric) is a mage/warrior hybrid.
