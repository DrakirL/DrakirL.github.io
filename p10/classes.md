# Class
A character's class is their role as an adventurer, defining most of their features, mainly the most powerful ones. <br>
When you choose your class, you will also get to pick a subclass to define what flavor your character plays their role with.<br>
<br>
**Warriors** <br>
As an adventurer, combat against monsters is inevitable. The warrior classes are always as ready they can be to throw down. <br>
For this test, the [Knight](/p10/class/knight) is a purebred warrior, and the [Ranger](/p10/class/ranger) is a warrior/expert hybrid. <br>
<br>
**Experts** <br>
Not all problems are creatures to kill, and not all problem creatures are best dealt with by killing them. Experts are always prepared to tackle such issues in various ways. <br>
For this test, the [Rogue](/p10/class/rogue) is a purebred expert, and the [Bard](/p10/class/bard) is an expert/mage hybrid. <br>
<br>
**Mages** <br>
Magic is the ability to turn imagination real and make the impossible possible. It's useful for both combat or non-combat purposes, but it's costly either way. <br>
For this test, the [Wizard](/p10/class/wizard) is a purebred mage, and the [Cleric](/p10/class/cleric) is a mage/warrior hybrid. <br>
