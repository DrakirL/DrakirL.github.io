# Class
A character's class is their role as an adventurer, defining most of their features, mainly the most powerful ones.

## Warriors
As an adventurer, combat against great threats is inevitable. The Warrior classes are always as ready as anyone could be to throw down on a moments notice, and remain ready even after several rounds.<br><br>

[Knight](/p10/class/knight)<br>
[Monk](/p10/class/monk)<br>

## Experts
Not all problems are creatures to kill, and some creatures are uniquely problematic to kill. The Expert classes are equipped to focus on handling specific issues, and remain adaptable enough to change that focus.<br><br>

## Mages
Magic is the ability to turn imagination real and make the impossible possible. Though costly, it is an invaluable asset for any group looking to leave a mark on the world. The Mage classes are the most adept at wielding it.
