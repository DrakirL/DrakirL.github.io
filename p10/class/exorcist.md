Pick a Level 1 Talent from your chosen Exorcist Subclass.

### Level 1: Sworn Enemy
Choose a creature type. Add it as Training. (PHRASING?)<br>
*Note: This means that you should get Advantage on Tests of Skill that relates to your chosen creature type. You have lots of experience/knowledge to draw from.*<br><br>

If a creature is of the type you chose, it counts as a Sworn Enemy for you.<br>
Whenever you score a hit with a Martial Attack against a Sworn Enemy, you may increase the Degree of Success for that Attack by 1.

### Level 1: Baleful Brand
**Prerequisite:** *Sworn Enemy*.<br>
When you target a creature with a Martial Attack, you can first spend 1 MP to Brand it.<br>
While a creature is Branded by you, it counts as a Sworn Enemy for you.<br>
You also know the direction towards the Branded creature’s location at all times, provided it is on the same plane of existence as you.<br><br>

Your Brand remains for up to a day, until you Brand a different creature, you use 1 Action on your turn to touch the creature and remove your Brand, or your Brand is dispelled (as if it were a Spell you casted).

### Level 1: Enhancement? Rite
You can use 1 Action on your turn to enhance up to two weapons you are holding. You can use a weapon you've enhanced this way as though it was any type of Focus. The enhancement remains for a minute, until you let go of the weapon, or you use this ability again.<br>

### Level 2: Nowhere to Hide
**Prerequisite:** *Baleful Brand*.<br>
While a creature is Branded by you, it gains no benefit from being concealed by an illusory effect (including disguises and invisibility. PHRASING?) and it automatically fails any Test it makes to hide itself or conceal its actions.<br>
If it attempts to magically alter its form in any way (except for returning to its true form), it must make a Will Save against your Magic Might. On a failed Save, the attempt to change its form fails and the creature is Stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Level 5: Sealed Fate
