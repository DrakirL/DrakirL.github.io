## Exorcist Class Features
These are the core features granted for the Exorcist Class.

### Level 1: Sworn Enemy
Choose a creature type. Add it among your Training. (PHRASING?) <br>
*Note: This means that you should get Advantage on any Test that relates to your chosen creature type. You should have a lot of experience/knowledge to draw from.*
<br><br>
If a creature is of the type you chose, it counts as a Sworn Enemy for you. When you hit one of your Sworn Enemies with a Martial Attack, you may add your Rite? Die (which is a d4) to the damage you deal.<br>
You can only add this bonus once per Action (PHRASING?)

### Level 1: Baleful Brand
When you hit a creature with a Martial Attack, you may bind its essence to yours, leaving it Branded before acting on the effects of the attack. (PHRASING?) <br>
While creature is Branded by you, you can treat that creature as if it were your Sworn Enemy regardless of its creature type. <br>
You also know the direction towards the Branded creature’s location at all times, provided it is on the same plane of existence as you.
<br><br>
Your Brand remains until you Brand a different creature, you use 1 Action on your turn to touch the creature and remove your Brand, or your Brand is dispelled (as if it were a spell with a Rank equal to your Level). <br>
You can use this feature once per Rest.

<br><br>
The enhancement lasts for up to a minute, until you let go of the weapon, or use this feature again. <br>
When you hit a creature with the enhanced weapon, it takes extra damage of the chosen type equal to your Rite Die.
