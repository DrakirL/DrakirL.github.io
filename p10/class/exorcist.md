## Exorcist Class Features
These are the core features granted for the Exorcist Class.

### Core: Sworn Enemy
Choose a creature type. Add it among your Training. (PHRASING?) <br>
*Note: This means that you should get Advantage on Tests that relates to your chosen creature type. You have lots of experience/knowledge to draw from.*
<br><br>
If a creature is of the type you chose, it counts as a Sworn Enemy for you. When you hit one of your Sworn Enemies with a Martial Attack, you raise the Attack's Degree of success by 1.

### Core: Baleful Brand
When you hit a creature with a Martial Attack, you can spend 1 MP to Brand it before causing any of the attack's effects. (PHRASING?) <br>
While a creature is Branded by you, you can treat that creature as if it were your Sworn Enemy regardless of its creature type. <br>
You also know the direction towards the Branded creature’s location at all times, provided it is on the same plane of existence as you.
<br><br>
Your Brand remains until you Brand a different creature, you use 1 Action on your turn to touch the creature and remove your Brand, or your Brand is dispelled (as if it were a spell with a Rank equal to your Level).

### Level 1: Weapon Bond? Rite of Enhancement?
You can use 1 Action on your turn and spend 1 MP to enhance a weapon you are holding. You can use a weapon you have enhanced this way as a focus to cast any spell you know. The enhancement lasts for up to a minute, until you let go of the weapon, or use this feature again. <br>
When you enhance the weapon, choose one of the following damage types: Sonic, Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Infernal, Radiant, or Necrotic. When you deal damage with the enhaced weapon, you may change the damage dealt to the type you chose.

### Level 1: Sixth Sense?
You can use 1 Action on your turn to detect the exact location of any of your Sworn Enemies within 100 paces of you. <br>
Also detects its "influence", such as spells or other terrain effects. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)

### Level 2: Brand of Axiom/Unveiling? Nowhere to Hide?
While a creature is Branded by you, it gains no benefit from being concealed by an illusory effect (including disguises and invisibility. PHRASING?), it automatically fails any Test it makes to hide itself or its actions, and if it attempts to magically alter its form in any way (except for returning to its true form), it must make a Will Save against your Magic Might. <br>
On a failed Save, the attempt to change its form fails and the creature is Stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Level 3: Hardened Heart
You gain Advantage on any Save that one of your Sworn Enemies forces you to make.

### Level 4: Brand of Binding/Tethering? Nowhere to Run?
While a creature is Branded by you, any Speed it has is reduced to 1 pace, it can’t sprint as part of the Move Action, and if it attempts to teleport or leave its current plane by any means, it must make a Will Save against your Magic Might. <br>
On a failed Save, the attempt to teleport or leave the plane fails and the creature is Stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Level 5: Sealed Fate
When you make a Martial Attack against one of your *Sworn Enemies* and miss, you may still deal half damage. (DETAILS? PHRASING? More?)
