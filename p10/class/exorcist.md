#### <br>

Pick a Level 1 Talent from your chosen Exorcist Subclass.

### Level 1: Sworn Enemy
Choose a creature type. Add it as Training. (PHRASING?)<br>
*Note: This means that you should get Advantage on Tests of Skill that relates to your chosen creature type. You have lots of experience/knowledge to draw from.*<br><br>

If a creature is of the type you chose, you may treat it as a Sworn Enemy.<br>
Whenever you make an Attack against a Sworn Enemy, you may roll a d4 and add it to your result.

### Level 1: Baleful Brand
When you target a creature with a Martial Attack, you can spend 1 MP to Brand it before attempting the Test.<br>
While a creature is Branded by you, you may treat it as a Sworn Enemy.<br>
You also know the direction towards the Branded creature’s location at all times, provided it is on the same plane of existence as you.<br><br>

Your Brand remains for up to a day, until you Brand a different creature, you use 1 Action on your turn to touch the creature and remove your Brand, or your Brand is dispelled (as if it were a Spell you casted).

### Level 1: Enhancement Rite
You can use 1 Action on your turn and spend 1 MP to enhance a weapon you are holding. You can use a weapon you have enhanced this way as a focus to cast any Spell you know. The enhancement remains for a minute, until you let go of the weapon, or use this feature again. <br>
When you enhance the weapon, choose one of the following damage types: Sonic, Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Infernal, Radiant, or Necrotic. When you deal damage with the enhaced weapon, you may change the damage dealt to the type you chose.

### Level 1: Sixth Sense?
You can use 1 Action on your turn to detect the exact location of each creature that you treat as a Sworn Enemy within 100 paces of you. <br>
Also detects its "influence", such as spells or other terrain effects. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)

### Level 2: Brand of Axiom/Unveiling? Nowhere to Hide?
While a creature is Branded by you, it gains no benefit from being concealed by an illusory effect (including disguises and invisibility. PHRASING?), it automatically fails any Test it makes to hide itself or its actions, and if it attempts to magically alter its form in any way (except for returning to its true form), it must make a Will Save against your Magic Might. <br>
On a failed Save, the attempt to change its form fails and the creature is Stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Level 3: Hardened Heart
You gain Advantage on any Save a Sworn Enemies forces you to make.

### Level 4: Brand of Binding/Tethering? Nowhere to Run?
While a creature is Branded by you, any Speed it has is reduced to 1 pace, it can’t sprint as part of the Move Action, and if it attempts to teleport or leave its current plane by any means, it must make a Will Save against your Magic Might.<br>
On a failed Save, the attempt to teleport or leave the plane fails and the creature is Stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Level 5: Sealed Fate
When you make a Martial Attack against a Sworn Enemy and miss, you may still deal half damage. (DETAILS? PHRASING? More?)
