### Level 1: Sacred Order
**Prerequisite:** Proficiency (Divine Focus).<br>
Embracing the purpose of carrying out the gods' will in their name, you've learned how you can best do so.<br>
Choose one of the following benefits:

#### Crusader
You can perform a 1 minute ritual to summon an Advanced Weapon of your choice into your hands. You can use it as a Divine Focus.<br>
A weapon you have summoned this way is visibly magical in nature, and will be unsummoned if you perform this ritual again, the weapon stays outside your Reach for more than an hour, or if you die.<br><br>

If Cleric is your main Class, you also gain Proficiency with Advanced Melee Weapons, Advanced Ranged Weapons, and Heavy Armor.

#### Herald
You learn 2 Spells of your choice. You can cast each spell learned this way as though they were Divine Spells, even if they aren't.

### Level 1: Divine Invervention
You have a Miracle Value, starting at 1.<br>
You can use 3 Actions on your turn to say a prayer and try call on your deity to intervene on your behalf.<br>
Describe the assistance you seek and roll a d20. If the number rolled is no higher than your Miracle Value, the prayer is immidiately answered as the deity directly intervenes, briefly appearing to provide the assistance you prayed for. <br>
The GM decides how the intervention takes form, usually by creating the effects of any one Divine Spell without requiring any MP or materials. *(Guideline: You'd roll with the player's Magic so damage scaling isn't an issue. Give God unlimited resources to spend!)*
<br><br>
If your deity does intervene, you can't call for its aid this way again until you've finished a Long Rest.

### Level 1: Devotion (*Repeatable*)
**Prerequisite:** *Divine Intervention*.<br>

#### Divine Spark
You present your holy symbol to a creature within 60 feet of you. It either regains HP equal to a number of d8s equal to your Level or it must make a Charisma Save (your choice). <br>
A creature takes Radiant or Infernal damage (your choice) equal to equal to a number of d8s equal to your Level on a failed Save, or half as much on a success.
