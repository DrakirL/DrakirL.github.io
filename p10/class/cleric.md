#### <br>

**Herald** <br>
You learn 3 Spells of your choice. You can cast each spell learned this way as though they were Divine Spells, even if they aren't.<br>

### Level 1: Divine Spark
You can use any Channel Divinity Ability you have once per Rest. *PHRASING?
If a Channel Divinity Ability forces a creature to make a Save, it is made against your Magic Might.
<br><br>
In addition, you gain the Channel Divinity Ability: *Divine Spark*.

#### Divine Spark
You present your holy symbol to a creature within 60 feet of you and make a Spell Test. It either regains HP equal to your Degree of Success or it must make a Charisma Save (your choice). <br>
A creature takes Radiant or Infernal damage (your choice) equal to your Degree of Success on a failed Save, or half as much on a success.

### Level 2: Divine Wrath
When you deal damage to one or more creatures with an attack or Spell, you can deal an additional 1d8 damage to one of those creatures. <br>
After you've dealt this damage, you can't do so again until you regain your Actions.
<br><br>
The damage dealt this way is either Infernal or Radiant. You choose which when you gain this feature.

### Level 1: Divine Invervention *(Repeatable)*
You can use 3 Actions on your turn to say a prayer and try call on your deity to intervene on your behalf. <br>
Describe the assistance you seek and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number no higher than your, the prayer is immidiately answered as the deity directly intervenes, briefly appearing to provide the assistance you prayed for. <br>
The GM decides how the intervention takes form, usually by creating the effects of any one Divine Spell without requiring any MP or materials. *(Guideline: You'd roll with the player's Magic so damage scaling isn't an issue. Give God unlimited MP to spend!)*
<br><br>
If your deity does intervene, you can't call for its aid this way again until you've finished a Long Rest.

## Cleric Subclass: Domain of War.

### Level 1: War Priest?

After doing so, you can't do so again until you've regained your Actions.

### Level 1: Improved Channel Divinity???
You gain the following Channel Divinity Ability:
#### Guided Strike?
When a creature you can see within 20 feet of you misses an Attack, you can use 1 Action and use of your *Divine Spark* to add a +10 bonus to its roll, potentially changing the outcome.
