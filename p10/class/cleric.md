Pick a Level 1 Talent from your chosen Cleric Subclass.

### Level 1: Sacred Order
**Prerequisite:** Proficiency (Divine Focus).<br>
Embracing the purpose of carrying out the gods' will in their name, you've learned how you can best do so.<br>
Choose one of the following benefits:

#### Crusader
You can perform a 1 minute ritual to summon an Advanced Weapon of your choice into your hands. You can use any weapon you've summoned this way as a Divine Focus.<br>
A weapon you have summoned this way is visibly magical in nature, and will be unsummoned if you perform this ritual again, if you die, or if it stays outside your Reach for more than an hour.<br><br>

If Cleric is your main Class, you also gain Proficiency with Advanced Melee Weapons, Advanced Range Weapons, and Heavy Armor.

#### Herald
Choose any one Cleric Subclass and gain the *Invocation* talent listed under it.<br><br>

If Cleric is your main Class, you also learn the Domain Spells of that Cleric Subclass. They count as Divine Spells for you. (PHRASING? DETAILS?)

### Level 1: Divine Invervention
You have a Miracle Value, starting at 1.<br>
You can use 3 Actions on your turn to say a prayer and try call on your deity to intervene on your behalf.<br>
Describe the assistance you seek and roll a d20. If the number rolled is no higher than your Miracle Value, the prayer is immidiately answered as the deity directly intervenes, briefly appearing to provide the assistance you prayed for.<br>
The GM decides how the intervention takes form, usually by creating the effects of any one Divine Spell without requiring any MP, materials, or additional casting time. *(Guideline: You'd roll with the player's Magic so damage scaling isn't an issue. Give God unlimited resources to spend!)*<br><br>

If your deity does intervene, you can't call for its aid this way again until you've finished a Long Rest.

### Level 1: Devotion (*Repeatable*)
**Prerequisite:** *Divine Intervention*.<br>
You learn 1 Divine Spell of your choice.<br>
Increase your Miracle Value by 1.

You can now Invoke your deity up to twice per Rest.

### Level 3: Serve the Order! Deus Vult!? Sacred Service?
**Prerequisite:** *Sacred Order*.<br>
You gain one of the following benefits, determined by the Order you've chosen:

#### Crusader
After you hit a creature with a Martial Attack, you can deal it X damage, where X is the Degree of Success for that attack.<br>
The damage dealt this way is either Radiant or Umbral. You choose which when you gain this talent.

#### Herald
After you cast a Divine Spell, you may either deal X damage or restore X HP to a creature within the Spell's range, where X is the MP you spent on that casting.<br>
Any damage dealt this way is either Radiant or Umbral. You choose which when you gain this talent.


### Level 4: Perfected Invocation
**Prerequisite:** *Improved Invocation*.<br>
You can now Invoke your deity up to 3 times per Rest.

### Level 5: Deus Vult?
**Prerequisite:** *Divine Intervention* (Miracle Value 5+).<br>
Increase your Miracle Value by 10.<br>
More? During Long Rest, spend X times 100 gc on prayer/ritual to permanently increase miracle value by 1, up to 20?

## Cleric Subclass: Domain of Death.

### Level 1: Invocation
**Prerequisite:** Proficiency (Divine Focus)?<br>
You can use a Divine Focus and Invoke your deity to cause the effect of any one Invocation you know.<br>

You learn the following Invocation:

#### Touch of Death
*BIG single target Withering damage (DETAILS?)

### Level 1: Inescapable End
Whenever you would deal either Physical or Spiritual damage to a creature, you may change its type to Withering damage.<br>
