### Level 1: Traditional Wisdom
You learn to spot and read the secret druidic signs, which are hidden simple descriptive messages made by shaping glyphs out of cracks in stones or the lines in the bark of living trees. As most accessable places of interest have been found by an experienced druid at some point throughout history, you can expect to find such messages near their entrance or somewhere on the way leading up to it.<br>
*As GM, I beg of you to ask "are there any Druidic Markings here?" from time to time. I will forget to mention them, but they're supposed to be all around and act as a free hint system.*

### Level 1: Wild Shape
You learn the forms of three different creatures of your choice; One Small or smaller, one Medium, and one Large or larger. Each form learned this way must be that of an Unlevelled Beast.<br>
Provided you have no used Actions, you can spend 1 MP on your turn to shape-shift into one of the forms you've learned. Your inventory melds into the new form and can't be accessed, used, or otherwise benefitted from.<br>
Whilst transformed in this way, the following rules apply:
+ Your appearance, size, and creature type are that of the form's.
+ You use the form's Attributes instead of your own.
+ You use the form's Speeds instead of your own.
+ You use the form's Learned Skills instead of your own.
+ You use the form's Defence and Awareness instead of your own.
+ You have only the form's Training and Proficiencies.
+ You have only this Talent and the form's Talents.
+ You have only the form's physical capabilities and senses.
+ Any items merged into your form counts towards your Carrying Capacity.
#### <br>

When you end your turn whilst transformed, you regain 1 HP. Then, you must either return to your true form or spend 1 MP to remain transformed. You must make this choice before you regain any Actions.<br>
You are also forced to return to your true form if you either enter Death's Door or die outright.
