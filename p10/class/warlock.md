## Warlock Class Features
These are the core features granted for the Warlock Class.

### Level 1: Pact Boon
Your Pact Die is a d4. <br>
You can use the Boon as a focus to cast any Spell you know.

#### Boon of the Bauble
Your Boon is an accessory of immense power. It is perpetually Worn as you (and everyone else) are unable to remove it from your body. <br>
You become an Expert! <br>
You can summon a *Familiar* at no cost. The ritual to do so takes an hour. You can only have one familiar at a time. <br>
It is a Tiny creature of the same type as your patron. It has 0 in all Attributes, no Skill Points, HP equal to your Level, and 1 Action each round. <br>
Your Familiar (and you?) can use 1 Action to Eldritch Blast: Dealing one target Pact Die damage (choose type when you gain this feature), no roll required. <br>

#### Boon of the Blade
Your Boon is a strange aura you can use to inexorably bind a weapon to your very essence. You also get a Martial Weapon of your choice to start off.
You become a Warrior! You gain Proficiency with Advanced Melee Weapons, Advanced Ranged Weapons, Heavy Armor, and Large Shields. <br>
You can use 1 Action and attune to a weapon, magical or otherwise, to make it your Bound Weapon. (PHRASING?)
Your Bound Weapon acts as your Pact Boon, and you can use 1 Action on your turn to either summon your Bound Weapon to your hand or unsummon it to the aether, wherever it is. <br>
If you are wielding your Pact Weapon, you add one Pact Die to the Weapon Damage it deals on a hit. <br>

#### Boon of the Book
Your Boon is a tome of otherworldly knowledge that only you seem to understand. You can take a minute to summon a new copy of it into your hands, causing the original to disintegrate, wherever it is. <br>
You become a Mage! And a full-scale spellcaster at that! <br>
Choose a Spell List to be your chosen Sorcery List? At each level, you learn 3 Spells from that List. No Spell learned this way may be of a Rank higher than your Level.<br>

### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations/Mystic Arcanum?
At each Level, you learn one Spell of your choice with a Rank equal to your Level. <br>
If you don't have any Spell Slots, you may cast each Spell you've learned this way once per Adventure without expending one.
