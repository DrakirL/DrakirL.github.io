### Level 1: Pact Boon
Your Pact Die is a d4. <br>

#### Boon of the Bauble
Your Boon is an accessory radiating a mystical aura. It is perpetually Worn as you (and everyone else) are unable to remove it from your person. <br>
You become an Expert! <br>
You can summon a *Familiar* at no cost. The ritual to do so takes an hour. You can only have one familiar at a time. <br>
It is a Tiny creature of the same type as your patron. It has 0 in all Attributes, no Skill Points, HP equal to your Level, and 1 Action each round. <br>
Your Familiar (and you?) can use 1 Action to Eldritch Blast: Dealing one target Pact Die damage (choose type when you gain this feature), no roll required. <br>

Your Boon is a tome full of otherworldly knowledge that only you seem to comprehend. You can take a minute to summon a new copy of it into your hands, causing the original to disintegrate, wherever it is. <br>
You become a Mage! And a full-scale spellcaster at that! <br>
