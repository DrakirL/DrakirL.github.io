### Level 1: Pact Boon
Your Pact Die is a d4. <br>
You can use the Boon as a focus to cast any Spell you know.
#### Boon of the Bauble
Your Boon is an accessory of immense power. It is perpetually Worn as you (and everyone else) are unable to remove it from your body. <br>
You become an Expert! <br>
You can summon a *Familiar* at no cost. The ritual to do so takes an hour. You can only have one familiar at a time. <br>
It is a Tiny creature of the same type as your patron. It has 0 in all Attributes, no Skill Points, and HP equal to your Level. <br>
Your Familiar can use its 1 Action to Eldritch Blast: Dealing Pact Die damage (choose type when you gain this feature), no roll required. <br>
#### Boon of the Blade
Your Boon is a melee weapon that is inexorably bound to you. You can use 1 Action on your turn to either summon it to your hand or unsummon it to the aether, wherever it is. <br>
You become a Warrior! You gain Proficiency with Advanced Melee Weapons, Advanced Ranged Weapons?, Heavy Armor, and Large Shields. <br>
Attacks with the weapon deal 2 Pact Die damage on a hit. The damage type is either Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing (choose when you gain), ignoring any and all resistances. <br>
You may break bond to forge it with a different weapon?
#### Boon of the Book
Your Boon is a tome of otherworldly knowledge that only you seem to understand. You can take a minute to summon a new copy of it into your hands, causing the original to disintegrate, wherever it is. <br>
You become a Mage! And a full-scale spellcaster at that! <br>
