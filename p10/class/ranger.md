## Ranger Class Talents
These are the Talents accessible to the Ranger Class.

### Core: Ranger's Mark
You can use 1 Action on your turn to focus your attention on a creature you can see. Make a Martial Test against that creature's Defence. <br>
On a success, that creature becomes Marked by you for up to a day, requiring your Concentration. <br>
When you make a Martial Attack against a creature you have Marked in this way, you roll a your Mark Die and add it to your total. (PHRASING?) <br>
Your Mark Die is determined by your level: 1=d4, 2=d6, 3=d8, 4=d10, 5=d12. (PHRASING?)

### Core: Trailblazer
Being trained for partaking in great journeys, you gain the following benefits:
+ Your party's travelling pace is not slowed by Difficult Terrain. <br>
+ You can partake in up to 2 activities whilst travelling. <br>
+ You gain Advantage on any Test of Endurance you make to avoid gaining Exhaustion.<br>
+ You can't become lost except by magical means. (Enforced how?) <br>
#### <br>

### Level 1: Pathfinder
As an adept at traversing all types of terrain, you gain the following benefits: <br>
+ Your Walk Speed increases by 1 Pace.<br>
+ You have Climb Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Walk Speed.<br>
+ You can ignore the effects of Difficult Terrain as you're moving through it.<br>
#### <br>

### Level 1: Rangers' Conclave
Choose a Ranger Subclass. You may count each Talent listed under it count as a Ranger Class Talent.<br>
Your options are the following:
+ Beastmasters' Conclave
+ Commandos' Conclave
+ Explorers' Conclave
+ Hunters' Conclave
+ Monster Slayers' Conclave
+ Nightstalkers' Conclave
+ Nomads' Conclave
+ Primeval Guardians' Conclave
+ Spiritcallers' Conclave
+ Trappers' Conclave
+ Weavewalkers' Conclave
#### <br>

Pick a Level 1 Talent from your chosen Ranger Subclass.

### Level 1: Survival of the Fittest? Grit?
Upon finishing a Rest, you regain an additional 1 HP and 1 MP. This bonus is not prevented if you have Exhaustion.

### Level 2: Informed Preparations? Target Locked?
After you finish a Rest, you may choose one individual creature and add its name (or at least a name you've chosen for it) amongst your Training. (PHRASING?) <br>
You can only have one individual creature named this way at a time. (PHRASING?) <br>
*To clarify, you don't have to know a creature's name. As long as you and the GM know what individual you're referring to, it's all good. The point is that only one individual creature is affected.* <br>
*NOTE: Having training means you can gain Advantage on any Test, except Attacks and Saves, where the training is relevant. The Test you make as part of your Ranger's Mark feature is neither an Attack or Save, and training would help when trying to spot a creature's weak points. Hint, hint* <br>

### Level 3: Camouflage? Vanishing Tracks? Nature's Veil? ???
You can use 1 Action on your turn to become Invisible until you use another Action? <br>
Can't be tracked unless you choose to leave a trail. (Enforced how?) <br>
Resistance to one or more damage types? Advantage against weather and temperatures? <br>
*THIS FEATURE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OR REPLACED!*

### Level 4: Unwavering Accuracy
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you have Blindsight. <br>
No Attack you make against a creature you can detect through this Blindsight can gain Disadvantage.

### Level 5: Lethal Precision
Whenever you would roll your Mark die, you may roll it twice and choose which result to use. <br>
In addition, your Concentration on your *Ranger's Mark* cannot be broken by damage.

## Ranger Subclass: Beastmaster
THEME: You have a trusted animal by your side, and it is as much of a trained combatant and explorer as you are.

### Level 1: Animal Companion?
You have a tamed Beast creature with a CR no higher than 1/2 as an additional member of your party. *For now, the wolf has already been prepared and is recommended.* <br>
This creature is known as your Companion, and it gains the following benefits: <br>
+ Its Martial and Magic Skills are equal to yours.
+ Its total number of Hit Dice equal to your Level, and its Maximum HP is determined by the increased pool. <br>
+ It gains 2 extra Skill Points to spend for each of your Levels.
+ It gains the Action "Special Trick": Make 1 Improvised Martial Attack and add your Mark Die to the roll. On a hit, deal damage equal to a number of Mark Die appropriate for its size (1 for Medium or smaller, +1 for each size above that). (PHRASING?) <br>
#### <br>
If your Companion would die (which should be rare, I'll use "taken out" instead), you can get a new one by spending a day and 50 gp worth of *stuff*. (PHRASING?) <br>

### Level 1: Loyal Friend?

#### <br>

## Ranger Subclass: Nomad
THEME: You've always/never belonged nowhere/everywhere/somewhere nearby/somewhere far away. You *exist*, in the most pure sense of the word.

### Level 1: Unknown Knowledge? Unearned/Unleared/Hidden Wisdom?
You learn 1 Language, gain any one Training of your choice, and learn any one Spell. Mark them all as "Unknown". (PHRASING? NAMING??) <br>
After you finish a Rest, you may replace your Unknown Language with another language, your Unknown Training with some other Training, and your Unknown Spell with a different Spell. You can cast your current "Unknown" Spell without using a Focus.
