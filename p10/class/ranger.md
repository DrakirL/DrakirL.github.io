## Ranger Subclass: Beastmaster
THEME: You have a trusted animal by your side, and it is as much of a trained combatant and explorer as you are.

### Level 1: Animal Companion
You have a tamed Beast creature as an additional member of your party. <br>
This creature is known as your Companion, and can come in any form you choose if it obeys the following parameters: <br>
+ It has Hit Dice equal to your Level. The size of the dice is determined by the creature's size (d4 if tiny, d10 if large). Its HP is determined by the dice as normal. <br>
+ It has only 1 Action per Round, but on its turn, it can take the Dash Action and any other Action at the same time. <br>
+ The sum of its Strength and Agility equals 5 + your Level. Its Intelligence and Charisma are both 0.
+ Its Martial Skill is always equal to your Level. It has 2 extra Skill Points per Level to spend on its other Skills.
+ It has Natrual Weapons it can make Melee Weapon Attacks with. The attack has the Finesse property, and deals 1 Mark Die damage on hit (either Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing). <br>
+ Any other special abilities you want are restricted by its size. For Example: Only a tiny Companion can have a Fly Speed, and only large creatures are Ridable.
#### <br>
(PHRASING FOR THE WHOLE THING?)
If your Companion would die (which should be rare, use "taken out" instead), you can get a new one by spending a day and 50 gp worth of *stuff*. (PHRASING?) <br>
