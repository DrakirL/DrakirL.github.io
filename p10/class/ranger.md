Pick a Level 1 Talent from your chosen Ranger Subclass.

### Level 1: Ranger's Mark
You can use 1 Action on your turn to focus your attention on a creature you can see.<br>
Make a Martial Test against that creature's Defence. On a success, that creature becomes Marked by you for up to a day, requiring your Concentration.<br>
Whenever you make an Attack against a creature you have Marked in this way, you may roll a Mark Die and add it to your total.<br>
The size of your Mark Die depends on your Level, according to the table below:<br><br>

Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12

### Level 1: Trailblazer
Being trained for partaking in great journeys, you gain the following benefits:
+ Your party's travelling pace is not slowed by Difficult Terrain.
+ You can partake in up to 2 activities whilst travelling.
+ You gain Advantage on any Test of Endurance you make to avoid gaining Exhaustion.
+ You can't become lost except by magical means. (Enforced how?)

### Level 1: Pathfinder
As an adept at traversing all types of terrain, you gain the following benefits:
+ Your Walk Speed increases by 1 Pace.
+ You have Climb Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Walk Speed.
+ You can ignore the effects of Difficult Terrain as you're moving through it.

### Level 1: Priority Target
Choose one individual creature to be your Priority Target. You can use its name (or at least a name you've chosen for it) as though it was Training.<br>
Upon finishing a Rest, you may select a different creature as your Priority Target. You can only have one Priority Target at a time.<br>
*To clarify, you don't have to know a creature's name. As long as you and the GM know what individual you're referring to, it's all good. The point is that only one individual creature is affected.*<br>
*NOTE: Having training means you can gain Advantage on Test of Skill, which excludes Attacks and Saves, where the training is relevant. The Test you make as part of your Ranger's Mark feature is neither an Attack or Save, and training would help when trying to spot a creature's weak points. Hint, hint*<br>

### Level 2: Survival of the Fittest
**Prerequisite:** *Trailblazer?*.<br>
Upon finishing a Rest while Exhausted, you still regain HP as normal.<br>
Upon finishing a Rest while not Exhausted, you regain twice as much HP.

You can use 1 Action on your turn to become Invisible until you use another Action? <br>
Can't be tracked unless you choose to leave a trail. (Enforced how?) <br>
Resistance to one or more damage types? Advantage against weather and temperatures? <br>
*THIS FEATURE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OR REPLACED!*

### Level 4: Unwavering Accuracy
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you have Blindsight.<br>
No Attack you make against a creature you detect with this Blindsight can gain Disadvantage.

### Level 5: Lethal Precision
**Prerequisite:** *Ranger's Mark*.<br>
Whenever you would roll your Mark die, you may roll it twice and choose which result to use.<br>
In addition, your Concentration on your *Ranger's Mark* cannot be broken by damage.
