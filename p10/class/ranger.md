The size of your Mark Die depends on your Level, according to the table below:<br><br>

Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12

### Level 1: Trailblazer
Provided you are nor Encumbered or Burdened whilst travelling, you can do one of the following things as part of your journey:
+ Focus on finding the least cumbersome route, letting party ignore the effects of Difficult Terrain as you're travelling through it.
+ Properly preparing for the outside conditions, granting yourself and up to two other members of your party Advantage on any Test of Endurance made to avoid gaining Exhaustion.
+ Partaking in an Activity no longer than 1 hour. *(Scouting, Foraging, or Researching are suggested, as they would make sense in any outdoors environment and/or on any journey towards a specific destination.)*

Upon finishing a Rest, you may select a different creature as your Priority Target. You can only have one Priority Target at a time.<br>
*To clarify, you don't have to know a creature's name. As long as you and the GM know what individual you're referring to, it's all good. The point is that only one individual creature is affected.*<br>
*NOTE: Having training means you can gain Advantage on Tests of Skill, which excludes Attacks and Saves, where the training is relevant. The Test you make as part of your Ranger's Mark feature is neither an Attack or Save, and training would help when trying to spot a creature's weak points. Hint, hint*<br>

If you can detect a target with this Blindsight, no attack you make against it can gain Disadvantage.

In addition, your Concentration on your *Ranger's Mark* cannot be broken by damage.
