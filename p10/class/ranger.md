#### <br>

Pick a Level 1 Talent from your chosen Ranger Subclass.

### Level 1: Ranger's Mark
You can use 1 Action on your turn to focus your attention on a creature you can see.<br>
Make a Martial Test against that creature's Defence. On a success, that creature becomes Marked by you for up to a day, requiring your Concentration.<br>
When you make a Martial Attack against a creature you have Marked in this way, you may add a d10 to your Dice Pool.

### Level 1: Trailblazer
Being trained for partaking in great journeys, you gain the following benefits:
+ Your party's travelling pace is not slowed by Difficult Terrain.
+ You can partake in up to 2 activities whilst travelling.
+ You gain Advantage on any Test of Endurance you make to avoid gaining Exhaustion.
+ You can't become lost except by magical means. (Enforced how?)

### Level 1: Pathfinder
As an adept at traversing all types of terrain, you gain the following benefits:
+ Your Walk Speed increases by 1 Pace.
+ You have Climb Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Walk Speed.
+ You can ignore the effects of Difficult Terrain as you're moving through it.

### Level 1: Survival of the Fittest? Grit?
Upon finishing a Rest, you regain an additional 1 HP and 1 MP. This bonus is not prevented if you have Exhaustion.

### Level 2: Informed Preparations? Target Locked?
After you finish a Rest, you may choose one individual creature (you've seen/interacted with?) and add its name (or at least a name you've chosen for it) amongst your Training. (PHRASING?) <br>
You can only have one individual creature named this way at a time. (PHRASING?) <br>
*To clarify, you don't have to know a creature's name. As long as you and the GM know what individual you're referring to, it's all good. The point is that only one individual creature is affected.* <br>
*NOTE: Having training means you can gain Advantage on any Test, except Attacks and Saves, where the training is relevant. The Test you make as part of your *Ranger's Mark* feature is neither an Attack or Save, and training would help when trying to spot a creature's weak points. Hint, hint* <br>

### Level 3: Camouflage? Vanishing Tracks? Nature's Veil? ???
You can use 1 Action on your turn to become Invisible until you use another Action? <br>
Can't be tracked unless you choose to leave a trail. (Enforced how?) <br>
Resistance to one or more damage types? Advantage against weather and temperatures? <br>
*THIS FEATURE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OR REPLACED!*

### Level 4: Unwavering Accuracy
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you have Blindsight. <br>
No Attack you make against a creature you can see with this Blindsight can gain Disadvantage.

### Level 5: Lethal Precision
Whenever you would roll your Mark die, you may roll it twice and choose which result to use. <br>
In addition, your Concentration on your *Ranger's Mark* cannot be broken by damage.

## Ranger Subclass: Beastmaster
THEME: You have a trusted animal by your side, and it is as much of a trained combatant and explorer as you are.

### Level 1: Animal Companion?
You have a tamed Beast creature with a CR no higher than 1/2 as an additional member of your party. *For now, the wolf has already been prepared and is recommended.* <br>
This creature is known as your Companion, and it gains the following benefits: <br>
+ Its Martial and Magic Skills are equal to yours.
+ Its total number of Hit Dice equal to your Level, and its Maximum HP is determined by the increased pool. <br>
+ It gains 2 extra Skill Points to spend for each of your Levels.
+ It gains the Action "Special Trick": Make 1 Improvised Martial Attack and add your Mark Die to the roll. On a hit, deal damage equal to a number of Mark Die appropriate for its size (1 for Medium or smaller, +1 for each size above that). (PHRASING?) <br>
#### <br>
If your Companion would die (which should be rare, I'll use "taken out" instead), you can get a new one by spending a day and 50 gp worth of *stuff*. (PHRASING?) <br>

### Level 1: Loyal Friend?
Both you and your Companion gains the following feature:
+ When an ally that is entirely within your reach takes damage, you can use 1 Action to reduce that damage by half. If you do so, you must also take the resulting damage.

+ *You learn a list of healing spells? You can cast them for free, provided you target your Animal Companion? DETAILS?
#### <br>

## Ranger Subclass: Nomad
THEME: You've always/never belonged nowhere/everywhere/somewhere nearby/somewhere far away. You *exist*, in the most pure sense of the word.

### Level 1: Unknown Knowledge? Unearned/Unleared/Hidden Wisdom?
You learn 1 Language, gain any one Training of your choice, and learn any one Spell. Mark them all as "Unknown". (PHRASING? NAMING??) <br>
After you finish a Rest, you may replace your Unknown Language with another language, your Unknown Training with some other Training, and your Unknown Spell with a different Spell. You can cast your current "Unknown" Spell without using a Focus.

### Level 1: Unseen Watcher? Uninvited Guest?
