These are the core features granted for the Ranger Class.

### Level 1: Pathfinder
As an adept at traversing all types of terrain, you gain the following benefits: <br>

+ You have Climb Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Speed. <br>
+ You can ignore the effects of Difficult Terrain while you're moving through it. (PHRASING?) <br>
#### <br>

### Level 1: Ranger's Mark
You can use 1 Action on your turn to focus your attention on a creature you can see. Make a Test of Marking/Marking Check? (unique to this feature) against that creature's Defence. You add your level and one attribute of your choice to your roll. <br>
If you succeed, that creature becomes Marked by you for up to a day, requiring your Concentration. <br>
When you make a Martial Attack against a creature you have Marked in this way, you roll a a d12? and add it to your total. (PHRASING?)

### Level 1: Ranger Subclass
You choose a Ranger Subclass and gain its Level 1 Features.

### Level 2: Trailblazer
While you are travelling, you gain the following benefits:
+ Your travelling party's pace is not slowed by Difficult Terrain. <br>
+ You can partake in up to 2 activities whilst travelling. <br>
+ *Advantage against overexertion? Or just no disadvantage from weather? <br>
+ You can't become lost except by magical means. (Enforced how?) <br>
#### <br>

### Level 2: Survival of the Fittest? Grit?
Whenever you finish a Rest, you regain 1 additional HP and MP.

### Level 3: Subclass Feature
You gain the Level 3 Feature of your chosen Ranger Subclass.

### Level 4: Informed Preparations? Target Locked?
After you finish a Rest, you may choose one individual creature (you've seen/interacted with?) and add its name (or some other distinct identifier) amongst your Training. (PHRASING?) <br>
You can only have one individual creature named this way at a time. (PHRASING?) <br>
*To clarify, you don't have to know a creature's name. As long as you and the GM know what individual you're referring to, it's all good. The point is that only one individual creature is affected.* <br>
*NOTE: Having training means you can gain Advantage on any Test, except Attacks and Saves, where the training is relevant. The Test you make as part of your *Ranger's Mark* feature is neither an Attack or Save, and training would help when trying to spot a creature's weak points. Hint, hint* <br>

### Level 5: Subclass Feature
You gain the Level 5 Feature of your chosen Ranger Subclass.

### Level 6: Camouflage? Vanishing Tracks? Nature's Veil? ???

No Attack you make against a creature you can see with this Blindsight can gain Disadvantage.

### Level 9: Subclass Feature
You gain the Level 9 Feature of your chosen Ranger Subclass.

### Level 10: Lethal Precision
Whenever you would roll your Mark die, you may roll it twice and choose which result to use. <br>
In addition, your Concentration on your *Ranger's Mark* cannot be broken by damage.

## Ranger Subclass: Beastmaster
THEME: You have a trusted animal by your side, and it is as much of a trained combatant and explorer as you are.

### Level 1: Animal Companion?
You have a tamed Beast creature with a CR no higher than 1/2 as an additional member of your party. *For now, the wolf has already been prepared and is recommended.* <br>
This creature is known as your Companion, and it gains the following benefits: <br>
+ Its Martial and Magic Skills are equal to yours.
+ Its total number of Hit Dice equal to your Level, and its Maximum HP is determined by the increased pool. <br>
+ It gains 2 extra Skill Points to spend for each of your Levels.

#### <br>
If your Companion would die (which should be rare, I'll use "taken out" instead), you can get a new one by spending a day and 50 gp worth of *stuff*. (PHRASING?) <br>
