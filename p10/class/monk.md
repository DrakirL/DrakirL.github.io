You are a master of your physical self, granting you the following benefits:
 + Your Unarmed Strikes now deal damage equal to your Balance Die (which is a d4) instead of 1.
 + When you take the Attack Action, you may make one attack as normal, followed by an Unarmed Strike. (As though you were two-weapon fighting with your fists, PHRASING?).
 + If you are wearing no armor, you can use Defence and Awareness interchangably? Add skill points to both? Something else???
 + When you would be hit by an Attack, you may use 1 Action to add your Balance Die to your Defence against that attack. (As if you were wielding a shield).
