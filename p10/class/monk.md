 + You can use 1 Action on your turn to make up to two Improvised Martial Attacks.

If this ability reduces the affected damage to 0, you may instead redirect the Attack to a different target. To do so, you select a new valid target and make a Martial Attack to replace the Attack's original roll.<br>
A Melee Attack redirected this way is aimed from the original attacker's position using its Reach.<br>
A Ranged Attack redirected this way is aimed from your position using your Throwing Range.<br>

+ You can use your Walk Speed whilst airborne, falling 1 pace for every 1 pace you move horizontally.
+ When you would take falling damage, you can make a Test of Acrobatics (Difficulty = 10 + the distance fallen) to reduce the damage you take by 1*.
