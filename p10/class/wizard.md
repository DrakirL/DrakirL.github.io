*NOTE: If you attempt to craft a magic item, having Training with the tools you use give you advantage.*

## Wizard Subclass: Chaos Theory
THEME: Magic is chaotic by default, and spells are just ways to tame its power. It must SURELY be more effective to just let it all loose, right?

### Level 1: Imbue with Potential
Take and hour and spend MP up to your Mana Spend Limit to store a spark in an object.<br>
A creature can use the object to release the spark, causing a Wild Magic Surge with a Surge Value equal to 2 times the MP spent when it was stored.<br>
A single object can't hold more than 1 spark at a time.

### Level 1: Arcane Flux
You can use 1 Action on your turn and spend MP up to your Mana Spend Limit to cause a Wild Magic Surge with a Surge Value equal to 2 times the MP spent.

### Level 2: Reflexive Flux
**Prerequisite: *Arcane Flux***<br>
After you take damage, you can use your *Arcane Flux* regardless of whose turn it is, even if the damage is lethal and Death's Door would deny you the Action.

### Level 3: Controlled Chaos
When you cause a Wild Magic Surge, you may roll on the table twice and choose which result to use.

### Level 4: Everything is Linked!
When you would cause a Wild Magic Surge, you can connect to another creature no further away than 1 pace outside your Reach. The creature you connect to this way causes the surge in your stead.<br>
You may choose to do this after you've determined the effect of the Surge.

### Level 5: ???

## Wizard Subclass: School of Abjuration
THEME: Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire. Most of the time, one'd fare best off fighting fire with an extinguisher.

### Level 1: Abjuration Savant
You learn 1 Arcane Abjuration Spell.<br>
The time and cost required to make a Spell Scroll is halved, provided the Spell you bind to it is an Abjuration Spell.
