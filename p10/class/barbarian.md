 + You gain Advantage on any Strength-based Skill Check you make. *Anything where Rage would be beneficial, like training? Is that too abstract?*
 #### <br>

 You can enter this Rage once per Rest? OR After your Rage ends, an hour must pass before you can enter it again?

Provided you are wearing no armor, your Speed is increased by 10 feet and you add your Save Skill/Martial Skill? to your defence? <br>
