## Barbarian Class Features
These are the core features granted for the Barbarian Class.

### Core: Rage!
You can at any point use 1 Action and spend 1 MP to enter a Rage. <br>
While your Rage is active, the following rules apply:
 + You can't cast or contribute to Spells.
 + You can't maintain Concentration.
 + Any Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage you take is halved.
 + When you deal damage with a Martial Melee Attack, increase the damage by 1.
 + Being hit by a Sudden Strike without an additional degree of success doesn't interrupt your Actions.
 + You can use "Rage" as Training? (PHRASING? Examples? Too vague?)
 #### <br>
 Your Rage lasts until you regain your actions, unless you spend 1 MP to extend it until the next round. (PHRASING? It is meant to be infinitely extendable) <br>
 After your Rage ends, you can't enter it again until you've finished a Rest?

### Core: Unbound
Provided you are wearing no armor, you are unbound and can utilize your freedom of movement, granting you the following benefits:
+ Your Walk Speed is increased by 2 paces.
+ You gain Protection equal to your Strength.

### Level 1: Reckless Fury
When you make Martial Melee Attack against a creature, you can do so with reckless abandon to gain Advantage on that Attack. <br>
When you do so, the target treats that Attack as Interruptible.

### Level 1: Danger Sense?
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you gain Advantage on any Strength or Agility Save you make against an effect you see coming, such as a spell being cast or a trap being triggered? (PHRASING? DETAILS?)

### Level 2: Unrelenting
If you would take lethal damage, you can make a Strength Save against a Difficulty of 10. <br>
If you succeed, the damage is not considered lethal, and you are put to 1 HP instead.
<br><br>
Each time you succeed on this Save, the Difficulty of this Save increases by 5.
After you finish a Rest, the Difficulty is reset to 10.

### Level 3: Brutal Finisher
When you deal damage to a creature with a Martial Melee Attack and its remaining HP is no higher than the damage it took, you can use 1 additional Action to immidiately set its HP to 0.

### Level 4: Unfaltering Strength
If you make a Test using a Strength-based Skill and roll a number on the die that is lower than your Strength, you may treat it as if it had rolled that number instead? <br>
OR... <br>
You now always have Advantage on any Strength Test you make, even without Raging?

### Level 5: Primal Champion?
Increase your Strength Attribute by 2, up to 7. <br>
