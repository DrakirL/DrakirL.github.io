### Level 1: Rage!
You can use 1 Action at any time to enter a Rage for up to an Hour or until you enter Death's Door.<br>
While your Rage is active, the following rules apply:
+ You can use "Rage" as though it was Training.
+ You can't cast or contribute to Spells.
+ You can't maintain Concentration.
+ Any Physical damage you take is halved.
+ Any Physical damage you deal with a Martial Melee Attack is doubled.
+ No Attack can Interrupt you, unless its Degree of Success is higher than Baseline.
#### <br>

After you regain your Actions whilst your Rage is active, you must either end your Rage or use 1 Action to maintain it.<br>
After your Rage ends, you can't enter it again until you've either finished a Rest or entered a new Action Scene.

### Level 1: Unbound
Provided you are wearing no armor, you can gain Protection equal to your Strength. Whilst you're using this Protection, your Walk Speed is increased by 2 paces.<br><br>

If Barbarian is your Main Class, increase both your Strength and your Agility by 1 each.

### Level 1: Reckless Abandon
When you make Martial Melee Attack against a creature, you may do so with reckless abandon to make it with Advantage. If you do so, the target treats that Attack as Interruptible.

### Level 1: Danger Sense
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you gain Advantage on any Strength or Agility Save you make against an effect you sense coming, such as a Spell being cast or a trap being triggered.

### Level 2: Brutal Finisher
When you hit a creature with a Martial Melee Attack and its remaining HP is no higher than the combined damage it took from that attack, you can have that damage be Lethal.<br>
If the target's remaining HP is greater than 0 when it is dealt Lethal damage this way, set its remaining HP to 0.

When a creature that is Frightened this way regains its Actions, it may repeat the Save. On a success, it stops being Frightened of you.

### Level 1: Wild Flailing?
