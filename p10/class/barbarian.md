### Level 1: Rage!
You can use 1 Action at any time to enter a Rage for up to an Hour or until you enter Death's Door.<br>
While your Rage is active, the following rules apply:
+ You can use "Rage" as though it was Training.
+ You can't cast or contribute to Spells.
+ You can't maintain Concentration.
+ Any Physical damage you take is halved.
+ Any Physical damage you deal with a Martial Melee Attack is doubled.
+ No Attack can Interrupt you, unless its Degree of Success is higher than Baseline.
#### <br>

After you regain your Actions whilst your Rage is active, you must either end your Rage or use 1 Action to maintain it.<br>
After your Rage ends, you can't enter it again until you've either finished a Rest or entered a new Action Scene.

### Level 1: Unbound
Provided you are wearing no armor, you can gain Protection equal to your Strength. Whilst you're using this Protection, your Walk Speed is increased by 2 paces.<br><br>

If Barbarian is your Main Class, increase both your Strength and your Agility by 1 each.

### Level 1: Reckless Abandon
When you make Martial Melee Attack against a creature, you may do so with reckless abandon to make it with Advantage. If you do so, the target treats that Attack as Interruptible.

### Level 1: Danger Sense
**Prerequisite:** *Unbound*.<br>
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you gain Advantage on any Strength or Agility Save you make against an effect you sense coming, such as a Spell being cast or a trap being triggered.

### Level 2: Brutal Finisher
When you hit a creature with a Martial Melee Attack and its remaining HP is no higher than the combined damage it took from that attack, you can have that damage be Lethal.<br>
If the target's remaining HP is greater than 0 when it is dealt Lethal damage this way, set its remaining HP to 0.

Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, no Save you make can gain Disadvantage.

You no longer need to use any Actions to maintain your Rage.
