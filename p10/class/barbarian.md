### Level 1: Rage!
You can use 1 Action at any point to enter a Rage for up to an Hour or until you enter Death's Door.<br>
While your Rage is active, the following rules apply:
+ You can't cast or contribute to Spells.
+ You can't maintain Concentration.
+ Any Baseline Attack that hits you won't Interrupt you.
+ Any Physical damage you take is halved.
+ Any Physical damage you deal with a Martial Melee Attack is doubled.
+ You can use "Rage" as though it was Training. (Examples? Too vague?)
#### <br>

After you regain your Actions whilst your Rage is active, you must either end your Rage or use 1 Action to maintain it.<br>
After your Rage ends, you can't enter it again until you've either finished a Rest or entered a new Action Scene.

### Level 1: Unbound
Provided you are wearing no armor, you are unbound and can use your freedom of movement to its fullest potential, granting you the following benefits:
+ Your Walk Speed is increased by 2 paces.
+ You have Protection equal to your Strength.

### Level 1: Reckless Abandon
When you make Martial Melee Attack against a creature, you may do so with reckless abandon and add a d8 to your Dice Pool. If you do so, the target treats your that Attack as Interruptible.<br>

### Level 1: Danger Sense?
Provided you aren't Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated, you gain Advantage on any Strength or Agility Save you make against an effect you sense coming, such as a spell being cast or a trap being triggered? (PHRASING? DETAILS?)

### Level 2: Unrelenting (DETAILS? PHRASING?)
If you would take lethal damage, you can make a Difficulty 10 Strength Save.<br>
If you succeed, the damage is not considered lethal, and you are put to 1 HP instead? Regain 1* HP, potentially undoing lethality?<br><br>

Each time you succeed on this Save, the Difficulty of this Save increases by 5.
After you finish a Rest, the Difficulty is reset to 10.

### Level 3: Brutal Finisher
After you deal damage to a creature with a Martial Melee Attack and its remaining HP is no higher than the physical damage it took, you can immidiately set its HP to 0 and treat the damage as Lethal?

### Level 4: Unfaltering Strength
You can't gain Disadvantage on any Test of Strength you make?

### Level 5: Untempered Frenzy
**Prerequisite:** "Rage!".<br>
You no longer need to use any Actions to maintain your Rage.

## Barbarian Subclass: Berserker
THEME: ???

### Level 1: Menacing Presence?
**Prerequisite:** "Rage!".<br>
When you enter your Rage, choose any number of creatures within 10 paces of you. Provided a creature can see or hear you, it must make a Will Save against your Martial Might or be Frightened of you until your Rage ends.<br>
When a creature that is Frightened this way regains its Action, it may repeat the Save. On a success, it stops being Frightened of you.

### Level 1: Ruthless Charge
You can use 1 Action on your turn to move up to your Walk Speed to a space where a hostile creature is within your Reach and make a Martial Melee Attack against that creature.

### Level 2: Mindless Rage
**Prerequisite:** "Rage!".<br>
While your Rage is active, you are immune to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. <br>
If you are either Charmed or Frightened, the effect of those conditions are suppressed whilst your Rage is Active.

Bonus damage against Frightened creatures?

### Level 4: Ruthless Chase?
When a creature from within your Reach moves out of your Reach, you can use 1 Action to move to the space they left and make a Sudden Strike against it? (EARLIER?)
