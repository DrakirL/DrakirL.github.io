# Attributes
Every creature has four different Attributes; Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Charisma, expressed as a value between 0 and 10. <br>
To determine these values for your character, shuffle 8 cards (two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, & two 4s,) and divide into them into 4 pairs. Assign the total of each pair to a different Attribute. Alternatively, you may just divinde 20 points as you wish (up to 10 in a stat). <br>
The value you have for an attribute determines your , as well as your potential to learn and improve your skills that rely on that attribute. When comparing creatures' stats to each other, just remember that this system is meant to put "people" and "monstrous creatures" on the same scale. <br>
*Note: Your attributes will be great to start, much better than any commoner, even at level 0. This is to let you act as a heroic adventurer, even at early levels. They will generally NOT increase. That kind of improvement over time, unleashing your full potential, is what Skill Points are for.*
