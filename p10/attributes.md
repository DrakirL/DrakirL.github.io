# Predefined Properties
Each creature has some arbitrarily decided values to describe what they are.<br>
These are then used to determine other, less arbitrary values.

## Attributes
Every creature has four different Attributes; Strength, Agility, Will, and Intelligence, expressed as a value between 0 and 5. <br>
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
"Normal" | "Good" | "Impressive" | "Significant" | "Amazing" | "Legendary"
#### <br>

When you create your character, use one of the following methods to determine its Attributes:
+ Assign each of the following values to a different Attribute of choice: 1, 2, 3, 4.
+ For each Attribute, roll a d20 and set its value to the result divided by 4 (rounded down).
+ Use 20 cards, 10 "zeros" and 10 "ones". Divide into four piles of 5 cards and assign the sum of each pile to a different Attribute.
#### <br>

*Note: Your attributes will start off great, much better than any commoner, even at "level 0". This is to let you act as a heroic adventurer from the get-go! They will generally NOT increase. That kind of improvement over time is what Experience is for.*<br>
