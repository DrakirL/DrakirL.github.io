# Attributes
Every creature has four different Attributes; Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Charisma, expressed as a value between 0 and 10. <br>
To determine these values for your character, shuffle 16 cards (four 0s, six 1s, four 2s, & two 3s) and divide into them into four piles with four cards in each. Assign the total of each pile to a different Attribute. <br>
(Alternatively, you may just divinde 20 points as you wish, up to 10 in a stat.) <br>
The value you have for an attribute determines the basis for your abilities. When comparing creatures' stats to each other, just remember that this system is meant to put "people" and "monstrous creatures" on the same standardized scale. <br>
*Note: Your attributes will start off great, much better than any commoner, even at level 0. This is to let you act as a heroic adventurer, even at early levels. They will generally NOT increase. That kind of improvement over time, unleashing your full potential, is what Skill Points and Experience are for.*
