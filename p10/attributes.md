# Attributes
Every creature has four different Attributes; Strength, Agility, Will, and Intelligence, expressed as a value between 0 and 5. <br>
When you create your character, assign each of the following values to a different Attribute: 4, 3, 2, 1 <br>
(Alternatively, you may just divinde 10 points as you wish (or randomly?), up to 5 in a stat. Or use 4 "d6-1"?) <br>
The value you have for an attribute determines the basis for your abilities. When comparing creatures' stats to each other, just remember that this system is meant to put "people" and "monstrous creatures" on the same standardized scale. <br>
*Note: Your attributes will start off great, much better than any commoner, even at level 0. This is to let you act as a heroic adventurer, even at early levels. They will generally NOT increase. That kind of improvement over time is what Skill Points and Experience are for.*
