# Background 
A character's background is the road they've taken in life before the call of adventure. <br>
It is usually defined as an occupation or a state such as "Refugee", "Folk Hero", or "Woke up with no memories". <br>
The benefits gained from your background customizable, as long as you follow this template: <br>
+ You learn one language (of any rarity).
+ You gain one Training of your choice. (PHRASING?)
+ You gain a total of 8 Skill Points to spend, evenly split between 4 different skills (2 for each), one for each attribute.
+ Choose one Level 0-feat.
+ Start with equipment and/or coinage worth a total of 25 gp (A good amount for a level 0 or 1 character).
+ Bonus Equipment: A thematically appropriate set of clothes. You can buy spare sets if you want, but being naked is NOT the default.
