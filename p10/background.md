# Background 
A character's background is the road they've taken in life since before the call of adventure. <br>
It is usually defined as an occupation or a state of being such as "Refugee", "Hero among orcs", or "Woke up with no memories". <br>
The benefits gained from your background customizable, as long as you follow this template: <br>

+ Starting Skills: For each Attribute, assign a d4 to one Skill listed under it.
