# Background 
A character's background is the road they've taken in life since before the call of adventure. <br>
It is usually defined as an occupation or a state of being such as "Refugee", "Hero among orcs", or "Woke up with no memories". <br>
The benefits gained from your background customizable, as long as you follow this template: <br>
+ You learn one language (of any rarity).
+ You gain Training in any one area.
+ Starting Skills: You put set your Grade for 4 different Skills, one for each attribute, to 1.
+ You gain one of the three starting bonuses (+5 max HP, +1 Grade to one Starting Skill, or learn a Rank 1 Cantrip from any list).
+ You start with equipment and/or coinage worth a total of 25 gp (A good amount for a level 0 or 1 character).
+ Bonus Equipment: A thematically appropriate set of clothes. You can buy spare sets if you want, but being naked is NOT the default.
