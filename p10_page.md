## Welcome to "Project 10"
In the wake of the WotC/OGL chaos, D&D as a system and brand has been in rough shape. Other systems have been eager to swoop in and adopt promising a classic dungeoncrawling experience. I have no interest in DMing a series of dungeons to merely crawl through.
<br>
I want to tell the stories that are only possible to tell in the world like what these game system traditionally present. To do that I want to use a system that adapts the same core mechanics to better support stories like those told in ExU: Calamity, the most adventurous seasons of Dimension 20, or the Legend of Vox Machina animated series. (Yes, these stories have been told using older systems. But I believe a system can be made to make telling them easier)

The content found on these pages is not finalized in any way. It is merely meant to gather and present the ideas where they can be easily understood and potentially playtested. If the wording is uninspired and/or leaves room for interpretation, the plan is to fix it as a finalized version is released.
