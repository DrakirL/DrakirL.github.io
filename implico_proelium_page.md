Implico Proelium is a puzzleing turn based score attack game where you, as a gladiator, fight against ever increasing waves of opponents to the impressed cheers of the colosseum's judges and audience.<br>
The more efficient you are with your moves, the more weapon options you'll be offered by the judges as a reward, and these weapons will help you survive the onslaught!

Implico Proelium was built in two parts:<br>
First, I developed a fully functional demo and prototype by myself over about two weeks of work. One week to pratice programming and another to practice UI-design. <br>
Second, I worked together with a single artist to develop the current version over about five weeks. I was the sole programmer and responsible for all desicions regarding game's design.<br>
