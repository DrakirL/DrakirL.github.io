IMPLICO PROELIUM is an upcoming tactical score chaser and turn based puzzle arena where you fight through increasing waves of opponents to impress the colosseum's audience.<br>
The more efficient you are with your moves, the more weapon options you'll be offered by the judges as a reward, and these weapons will help you survive the onslaught!

This demo was built by myself alone to pratice programming and UI-design. It took about two weeks of total work.<br>
The full version is currently being worked on, and will be uploaded here in a month or two. Stay tuned for the new years! :)
