**Project description:** Reading comprehension is one's the ability to absorb and understand the contents of a text whilst reading it, and is the basis for education in the modern day. Even if one has the right knowledge, giving the right answers becomes difficult without properly understanding the texts and questions. Because education is so important, reading comprehension is as well, and there is merit in putting effort into researching ways to increase student engagement and ability regarding the subject.
<br>
Engagement and motivation are important driving factors in getting students to learn. Videogames are designed with the purpose of keeping the user engaged in mind. Ergo, videogames could be designed as aid meant to keep students egaged in subjects such as reading comprehension.
<br><br>
This studie is mean to test if engaging with a text through logical puzzles can improve the reader's corehension of the text, as well as if specific game mechanics used in a text-reliant game can noticably affect the player's ability to comprehend the content of text long term. <br>
This is accomplished by develloping three different versions of a murder mystery visual novel game, each using the same script and having the same puzzles, but adding or removing other factors which make the different version more or less similar to games from the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series. <br>
Each participant played one of the three versions of the visual novel before taking a test quizzing them about the content of the games' dialogue. The intent is to spot any correlations between the version played, and the time spent playing between all participants.

### 1. Summary
Not yet available, as this study is still in progress.

### 2. Hypothesis
The hypothesis is that if students are made to engage with a text through puzzles, their ability to recall and reflect over its contents will be greater than if they had simply read it.

I also speculate that if students are made to engage with a text through action mechanics as well, it will not futher improve their potential to recall and reflect.
Instead, it may reduce the students' overall performance by serving as a distraction.

### 3. Tools and techniques
Games such as *Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney* or *Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc* are popular examples of games where comprehending text is a critical part of being able to complete the challenges they provide the player, and have therefore been used as inpiration for the games made for this study. <br>
The script used among the games is ispired by the game *Among Us*, as it's theme of basic murder mysteries match a simplified version of the other sources of inspiration. It was also chosen because of it already being well known amongst a large portion of the potential participants, and easy to grasp for others.<br>
The games were made using Unity 3D for its ease of use when rendering objects and sprites as well as when exporting and editing the different versions.
Läsförståelsetexten i denna studie i form av en mordgåta inspirerades av DR (2014) och har adapterats från Among Us (2018).

The dialogue manager used in all versions is overdevelloped for the purpose of the current study. It has support for including more characters and dialogue options intended for creating complete visual novel experiences. Read the full report for a more detailed overveiw.
