### 1. Summary
Not yet available, as this study is still in progress.

### 2. Hypothesis
The hypothesis is that if students are made to engage with a text through puzzles, their ability to recall and reflect over its contents will be greater than if they had simply read it.

I also speculate that if students are made to engage with a text through action mechanics as well, it will not futher improve their potential to recall and reflect.
Instead, it may reduce the students' overall performance by serving as a distraction.
