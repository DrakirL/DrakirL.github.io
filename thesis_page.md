**Project description:** Reading comprehension is a persons ability to absorb and understand the contents of a text whilst reading it, and is the basis for education in the modern day. Even if one has the right knowledge, giving the right answers becomes difficult without properly understanding the texts and questions. Because education is so important, reading comprehension is as well, and there is merit in putting effort in researching ways to increase student engagement and ability regarding the subject.
<br>
Engagement and motivation are important driving factors in getting students to learn. Videogames are designed with the purpose of keeping the user engaged in mind. Ergo, videogames could be designed to keep students engaged in subjects such as reading comprehension.
<br><br>
This study is meant to test if engaging with a text through logical puzzles can improve the reader's comprehension of the text, as well as if the specific game mechanics used in a text-reliant game can noticeably affect the player's ability to comprehend the content of text long term. <br>
This is performed by developing three different versions of a murder mystery visual novel game, each using the same script and having the same puzzles, but adding or removing other factors which make the different version more or less similar to games from the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series. <br>
Each participant is playing one of the three versions of the visual novel before taking a test quizzing them about the content of the games' dialogue. The intent is to spot any correlations between the version played and the performance on a reading comprehension test, as well as the time spent playing.

### 1. Summary
Denna  studie  syftade  till  att  kvantitativt  jämföra  hur  dataspelmekaniska  skillnader 
påverkar  spelares  förmåga  att  förstå  en  text.  Hypotesen  var  att  försökspersoner  som 
engagerat sig i texten via spel innehållande logikpussel presterar bättre på ett 
efterföljande läsförståelsetest om innehållet än de som läst texten utan pusselelement. 
För  att  testa  hypotesen  skapades  tre  spelversioner  för  presentation  av  samma  text:  
Visual Novel (VN) utan pusselelement, samt Phoenix Wright- (PW) och 
Danganronpainspirerade (DR) versioner med pusselelement. Ett bekvämlighetsurval på 
29  försökspersoner  rekryterades.  8,  11  respektive  10  försökspersoner  slumpades  att 
spela  version  VN,  PW  eller  DR,  följt  av  läsförståelsetestet.  Av  maxpoängen  23  på 
läsförståelsetestet  var  medelvärde  och  standardavvikelse  för  respektive  grupp:  VN 
10.6±4.7, PW 11.3±2.9, DR 13.4±4.0. Vid parvis jämförelse mellan grupperna 
identifierades  inga  signifikanta  skillnader.  Poweranalys  visade  att  studien  hade  krävt 
fler försökspersoner för statistiskt relevant hypotesprövning. Studien kan fungera som 
pilot för liknande framtida större undersökningar.

### 2. Hypothesis
The hypothesis is that if students are made to engage with a text through puzzles, their ability to recall and reflect over its contents will be greater than if they had simply read it.

I also speculate that if students are made to engage with a text through action mechanics as well, it will not futher improve their potential to recall and reflect.
Instead, it may reduce the students' overall performance by serving as a distraction.

### 3. Tools and techniques
Games such as *Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney* or *Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc* are popular examples of games where comprehending text is a critical part of being able to complete the challenges they provide the player, and have therefore been used as inpiration for the games made for this study. <br>
The script used in the games is ispired by the game *Among Us*, as it's theme of basic murder mysteries match a simplified version of the other sources of inspiration. Among Us was also chosen because it is already well known amongst a large portion of the potential participants, and easy to grasp for others.<br>
The games were made using Unity 3D for its ease of use when rendering objects and sprites as well as when exporting and editing the different versions.

Note that the dialogue manager used in all versions is overdeveloped for the purpose of the current study. It has support for including more characters and dialogue options intended for creating complete visual novel experiences. Read the full report for a more detailed overveiw.
