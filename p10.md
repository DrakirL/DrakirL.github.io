# Welcome to TtbT
In the wake of the WotC/OGL chaos, D&D as a system and brand has been in rough shape. Other systems have been eager to swoop in and adopt promising a classic dungeoncrawling experience. I have no interest in DMing a series of dungeons to merely crawl through.<br>
I want to tell the stories that are only possible to tell in the world like what these game system traditionally present,.<br>
To do that I want to use a system that adapts the same core mechanics to better support stories like those told in ExU: Calamity, the most adventurous seasons of Dimension 20, or the Mighty Nein animated series. (Yes, these stories have been told using older systems. But I believe a system can be made to make telling them *easier*).<br><br>

The content found on these pages is not finalized in any way. It is merely meant to gather and present the ideas in a comprehensive enough way to be potentially playtested. If the wording is uninspired and/or leaves room for interpretation, the plan is to fix it as a finalized version is released.<br><br>

My goals when creating this system are:
+ That you could run an adventure at any level(s) between 0 and 5 and have your character always feel just as heroic, and always be facing demanding obstacles.
+ That no character should feel like they are able to do *nothing* at any point, as no Actions should go unspent.
+ That each class feel different to play from the others, whilst every option remains equally capable during a major encounter.

## Character Creation
Before playing, you'll need a character to play as. Printable versions will be designed at some point, but testing will stick to a [digital spreadsheet-version]() for now.<br><!-- [sheets](/p10/sheets.pptx) -->
Once you've prepared a copy of the sheets, they can be filled out using the steps below in order (Attributes, Background, Class)<br>
[Attributes](/p10/attributes) <br>
[Background](/p10/background) <br>
[Class](/p10/classes) <br>
*NOTE: The Sheet-template is not yet ready for use.*

## Gameplay Rules
The core of the game uses a d20-system where outcomes are determined by making Checks (that may have Advantage or Disadvantage) and comparing them to set Difficulties.
