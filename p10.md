# Welcome to "Project 10"
In the wake of the WotC/OGL chaos, D&D as a system and brand has been in rough shape. Other systems have been eager to swoop in and adopt promising a classic dungeoncrawling experience. I have no interest in DMing a series of dungeons to merely crawl through. <br>
I want to tell the stories that are only possible to tell in the world like what these game system traditionally present. <br>
To do that I want to use a system that adapts the same core mechanics to better support stories like those told in ExU: Calamity, the most adventurous seasons of Dimension 20, or the Legend of Vox Machina animated series. (Yes, these stories have been told using older systems. But I believe a system can be made to make telling them *easier*).
<br><br>
The content found on these pages is not finalized in any way. It is merely meant to gather and present the ideas where they can be easily understood and potentially playtested. If the wording is uninspired and/or leaves room for interpretation, the plan is to fix it as a finalized version is released.
<br><br>
My goals when creating this system are:
+ That you could run an adventure at any level(s) between 0 and 10 and have your character always feel just as heroic, and always be facing demanding obstacles. <br>
+ That no character should ever feel like they are able to do *nothing*. If a character has actions to spend, there needs to be something worthwile to spend it on. <br>
+ That the classes all feel different to play from each other, but still be equally capable during major encounters. <br>

## Character Creation
Before playing, you'll need a character to play as. To do so, get a print of the [sheets](/p10/sheets.pptx) and fill it out using the steps below in order (Attribute, Background, Class)<br>
[Attributes](/p10/attributes) <br>
[Background](/p10/background) <br>
[Class](/p10/classes) <br>
*NOTE: The Sheet-template is not yet ready for use.*

## Gameplay Rules
The core of the game uses a d20-system where outcomes are determined by making Tests (that may have Advantage or Disadvantage).
