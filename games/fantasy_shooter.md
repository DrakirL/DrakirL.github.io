"Fantasy Shooter" was the working title of a small project I developed with a small team to become more familiar with the Unreal Engine and try out basic network based programming. <br>

<br>
It is a simple first person shooter where up to four players split into two teams to fight over the chance to kill goblins, steal their gold, and deliver enough of it to a control point before their opponents do. <br>
There are two distinct playable characters with different weapons, powerful spells, and passive traits.
