# DUAL OPERATIONS
<img src="images/DO_1.png?raw=true"/>
Dual Operations is a cooperative two-player stealth game where one player takes the role of a secret agent infliltrating a heavily guarded facility. The other player takes the role of the agent's operator, having access to a map of the facility and the ability to mess with facility's security systems.
The players will have to work together if they are to succeed in their mission to steal the enemy's secret plan and escape undetected.

Dual Operations is a the result of a game project course where students from different areas of study at the University of Sk√∂vde collaborate. In this project I worked as a programmer as well as the project manager for the team of 15 people. My duties included:
 - Debugging
 - Optimization
 - Implementing special effects
 - Coordinating output from the different discipline subteams
 - Making sure everybody contributed to the project
 - Scheduling and administration

## Instructions for setting up the game
Dual operations is meant to be played using two computers on the same local network, so that the players can be within earshot of each other. <br>
Each computer needs to have the game installed and running, and they both need to have granted the game access to send and recieve signals through port '7777' to allow the programs to communicate through the computers' firewalls.
<br><br>
If both players are on the same network, one of them can host the game by clicking the 'HOST GAME'-button and the other join the game the first player is hosting by writing the host's IP4-address in place of where it says 'localhost' and then clicking the 'JOIN GAME'-button. <br>
The game can be started after both players have clicked the 'READY'-button and is started by the hosting player clicking the 'START'-button. <br>
The hosting player will take the roll as operator and the one that joins will become their agent.
<br><br>
It is possible to test run the game on one computer by running the program twice and using "localhost" as the address, but since player control is restricted to the window that is currently open, actually playing this way is not feasible.
